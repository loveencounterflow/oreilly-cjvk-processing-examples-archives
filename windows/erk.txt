Email and Usenet newsgroups are encoded as 7 bit ASCII.

ASCII is sufficient for English, but poses problems for
languages that have thousands of characters, particularly
Chinese, Japanese and Korean.

These languages use multi-byte encoding schemes, which
rely on 8 bit characters and/or the Escape character.

Multi-byte encoded text is often damaged by email and usenet
services. The Email Repair Kit repairs this damage. 

Included are special tools for the encoding schemes used for
Japanese text. In addition, there is a general tool that
should repair damage in any multi-byte encoded language.
