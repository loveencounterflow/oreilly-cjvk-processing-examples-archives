KanjiCard v1.6 Sample					6/9/1996

  Kanjicard will run off a floppy disk, but works best when run from a
  hard drive.  To install Kanjicard, make a directory, and copy the
  uncompressed files into that directory.  i.e.,

    mkdir c:\kanjicrd
    copy kcards.exe c:\kanjicrd
    copy kcards.hlp c:\kanjicrd
    copy kana.rcb c:\kanjicrd
    copy grades.rcb c:\kanjicrd

  You can choose any name you like for the installation directory.

  To add KanjiCard to the windows program manager, select the File Menu
  under the program manager, and New.  Select to add a new Program Item,
  and specify where KanjiCard was installed.

						Enjoy!
