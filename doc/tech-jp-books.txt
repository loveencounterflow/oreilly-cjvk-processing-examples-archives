Field-Specific Textbooks for Technical Japanese

Technical Japanese Supplements
	The "Technical Japanese Supplements" are designed to provide
greater breadth and depth to instruction in technical Japanese. Most
of the supplements concentrate on the expressions, vocabulary, and
kanji that are essential for reading technical documents in one
specific field, building on the grammar and kanji introduced in the
textbook "Basic Technical Japanese" by Daub, Bird, and Inoue.
	All of the volumes have been designed as supplementary texts
for an introductory course in technical Japanese, but the readings and
exercises can be used for more advanced courses, as well. Each volume
can also be used independently for self-study by practicing scientists
or engineers who have some familiarity with Japanese grammar and wish
to concentrate on the vocabulary and expressions that are important in
their discipline.

Volume 1: Polymer Science and Engineering

By R. Byron Bird and Sigmund Floyd
ISBN 0-299-14694-4 (The University of Wisconsin Press)
ISBN 4-13-087055-6 (University of Tokyo Press)
Paper, 1995, $20.00

	This book is part of a series of supplements to the textbook
"Basic Technical Japanese." It introduces an additional 100 kanji that
are important in building vocabulary for reading and translating the
Japanese literature on polymer science and engineering.
	The text offers ten lessons, each of which introduces ten new
kanji as well as exercises for mastering them. The new kanji are
printed in very large type at the beginning of each chapter so that
the reader can see very clearly how the characters are structured. The
exercises include several types of matching exercises and translation
of sentences and short paragraphs. Full translations of some exercises
allow learners to evaluate their own work. In addition, a list of 35
more kanji related to polymer science is provided at the end of the
book. Intended for self-study, the book provides a complete on-kun
index of all 135 kanji, which enables learners, if they know the
pronunciation of a word, to locate the introductory discussion of the
corresponding kanji in the book.

Technical Japanese." Sigmund Floyd is Business Manager of AtoHaas

Volume 2: Biotechnology

By James L. Davis
ISBN 0-299-14714-2 (The University of Wisconsin Press)
ISBN 4-13-087053-X (University of Tokyo Press)
Paper, 1995, $25.00

	This book is part of a series of supplements to the textbook
"Basic Technical Japanese." It introduces 100 new kanji and over 1500
technical terms that appear frequently in documents dealing with
biotechnology, in addition to reviewing vocabulary containing the 365
kanji presented in "Basic Technical Japanese."
	In each of the ten lessons the text presents key vocabulary
and ten new kanji, which reappear in the exercises for that lesson and
throughout subsequent lessons, reinforcing learning. The exercises
emphasize vocabulary building, kanji recognition, definition matching,
and translation skills. An introductory lesson reviews the katakana
and hiragana writing systems, as well as the kanji presented in the
first ten chapters of "Basic Technical Japanese." The lessons in this
book have been keyed to the final ten chapters of "Basic Technical
Japanese," so that students can use the two volumes together to build
a Japanese vocabulary and to practice translation related to
biotechnology. In addition, a list of 35 more kanji related to
biotechnology is provided at the end of the book. Intended for
self-study, the book provides a complete on-kun index of all 135
kanji, which enables learners, if they know the pronunciation of a
word, to locate the introductory discussion of the corresponding kanji
in the book.

Volume 3: Kanji for Comprehending Technical Japanese

By Edward E. Daub
ISBN 0-299-14704-5 (The University of Wisconsin Press)
ISBN 4-13-087052-1 (University of Tokyo Press)
Paper, 1995, $30.00

	Designed as a companion and study guide for the textbook
"Comprehending Technical Japanese" (CTJ), this book may also be used as
a supplement to the textbook "Basic Technical Japanese." It provides
detailed explanations of the origin and meaning of the 500 kanji
featured in CTJ, which were chosen for their frequency and
significance in chemistry, physics, and biology.
	Each chapter is keyed to a chapter in CTJ, presenting twenty
kanji, vocabulary that use those kanji, a kanji-card format for study
and review, the Japanese essay that appears at the close of each CTJ
chapter, and its English translation. This volume also introduces
significant vocabulary in the sciences that include kanji other than
the 500 featured in CTJ.
