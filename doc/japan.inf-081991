     This article is a description of how to send and receive *real* Japanese 
text (i.e., kana and kanji) using electronic mail. I am absolutely delighted 
to share this information with others, and I would appreciate any comments on 
its content. Since some of the information contained within changes on a 
monthly, even weekly basis, I keep the current copy in electronic form. The 
current version of this article will be made available at two places: by 
anonymous FTP at ucdavis.edu (128.120.2.1) in the pub/JIS directory under the 
name japan.inf; and by contacting me directly through electronic mail to 
request a copy -- my electronic mail address is given above.

WHAT'S NEW
     This version has added material under the UNIX and NeXT sections in PART 
9. I have also added a paragraph in PART 6 which describes how to access 
NiftyServe from within CompuServe. In addition, the entire document, in 
general, was completely updated.
     Also new is the fact that as of July 1, 1991 I have been working at Adobe 
Systems Incorporated in the area of Japanese font production. Although I list 
my address here at Adobe Systems for contact purposes, Adobe Systems does not 
endorse this file which I have created, and have continued (and will continue) 
to update on a regular basis. This file is a personal endeavor to inform 
people of how Japanese can be handled on a variety of platforms.


INTRODUCTION
     Electronic mail has become a very efficient means of communicating both 
locally and world-wide. While it is very simple to send text which uses only 
the 94 printable ASCII characters, character sets which contains more than 
these ASCII characters pose special problems. In this article, I will describe 
how Japanese characters can be sent using electronic mail.
     This report contains actual Japanese text throughout, so don't be alarmed 
if strange sequences of ASCII characters appear. All Japanese contained in 
this file is in the New-JIS code.


PART 0: THE JAPANESE CHARACTER SET
     The Japanese character set as specified in the document JIS X 0208-1990 
(see Bibliography) currently includes 6,879 standard characters; 6,355 kanji 
in 2 levels (level 1: 2,965 kanji arranged by ON reading (the Chinese-based 
pronunciation); level 2: 3,390 kanji arranged by radical), 86 katakana, 83 
hiragana, 10 numerals, 52 English characters, 147 symbols, 66 Russian 
characters, 48 Greek characters, and 32 line elements (for making charts). 
This standard was first established in 1978, modified for the first time in 
1983 (4 kanji were appended to JIS level 2), and just modified again in 1990 
(2 kanji were appended to JIS level 2). This character set is widely 
implemented on a variety of machines. Encoding methods for JIS X 0208-1990 
include Shift-JIS, EUC, and JIS.
     Late in 1990 a new Japanese standard called JIS X 0212-1990 was published 
by Japanese Industrial Standards (JIS) which specified an additional 5,801 
kanji plus 21 symbols/diacritical marks and 245 Latin-based characters with 
diacritical marks. This means that there are now 12,156 standard kanji in 
Japanese. A future version of JAPAN.INF will go more into detail about the 
encoding methods for JIS X 0212-1990 (i.e., how it will be implemented, and 
when).


PART 1: 7-BIT JAPANESE CODES
     All of these 7-bit codes share a common character coding system, but 
their kanji-in (KI) and kanji-out (KO) escape sequences differ. We can use 
these in the United States, and are the most commonly used in Japan. The names 
in the parentheses below are other names for the same code (i.e., New-JIS is 
also called JIS). The most common of these codes is New-JIS.

EXAMPLES:
  New-JIS (JIS)
  Old-JIS
  NEC-JIS (NEC Kanji and NEC Code)

     The following is a table listing the kanji-in and kanji-out escape 
sequences for each of the three codes listed above (note the two types of 
kanji-out).

                    KI       KO (JIS-Roman)  KO (ASCII)
                    ^^       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  ^^^^^^^^^^
  New-JIS  (1983)   <ESC>$B  <ESC>(J         <ESC>(B
  Old-JIS  (1978)   <ESC>$@  <ESC>(J         <ESC>(B
  NEC-JIS  (1978)   <ESC>K   <ESC>H          n/a

     The difference between KO (JIS-Roman) and KO (ASCII) is very minor, and 
lies in only two characters. Their 8-bit extension do differ greatly, though. 
The 8-bit extension of the JIS-Roman character set contains half-size 
katakana. Also, most terminal software can emulate only one of the KO 
character sets no matter which one it receives. For example, NinjaTerm (to be 
described in PART 9) only emulates KO-ASCII.
     The difference between New-JIS and Old-JIS is minor. The reason for the 
existence of these two codes is due to the introduction of JOUYOU kanji (常用
漢字) in 1981. Previous to this, the standard in education were the 1850 kanji 
in TOUYOU kanji (当用漢字); JOUYOU kanji added an additional 95 kanji to 
TOUYOU kanji bringing the total to 1945. The JIS standard contains two levels 
of kanji, and the folks at JIS wanted to be sure that all JOUYOU kanji were 
included in the first level. So, in 1983, a new JIS standard was released. The 
people at JIS simply juggled positions of old and new forms of kanji (JIS 
level 1 contains the common forms of kanji, and their respective older forms 
are located in JIS level 2), and added 4 additional kanji to the second level. 
In 1990, the JIS standard was again modified due to the addition of 118 kanji 
to the JINMEI-YOU kanji (人名用漢字) list -- 2 of these 118 kanji were not 
found in the JIS standard, so they were appended to the end of JIS Level 2 
kanji. The character set used for NEC-JIS is identical to that of Old-JIS -- 
they only differ in their escape sequences.
     There are two types of New-JIS; one based on the 1983 standard, and one 
based on the 1990 standard. The only difference between them is that the 1990 
standard includes 2 additional kanji appended to JIS level 2. For all 
practical purposes they can be treated as the same.
     The KI escape sequence tells Japanese terminals to treat what follows as 
two-bytes per character. KO, on the other hand, tells Japanese terminals to 
treat what follows as one-byte per character (back to JIS-Roman or ASCII).
     A two-byte per character coding system using 7-bit bytes (ASCII) can 
encode up to 16,384 characters (128 by 128); however, the Japanese only use 
the 94 printable ASCII codes in their matrix, so it can only encode a maximum 
of 8,836 characters (94 by 94).
     Japanese text is represented as follows. A romanized version is given so 
that those who cannot view Japanese text can benefit, too.

  Japanese Text:                   これは日本語の文章です。
  (Romanized):               KO RE HA NI HON GO NO BUN SHOU DE SU .
  Raw Code (NO ESCAPE CODES)       $3$l$OF|K\8l$NJ8>O$G$9!#
  New-JIS:                  <ESC>$B$3$l$OF|K\8l$NJ8>O$G$9!#<ESC>(J
  Old-JIS:                  <ESC>$@$3$l$OF|K\8l$NJ8>O$G$9!#<ESC>(J
  NEC-JIS:                   <ESC>K$3$l$OF|K\8l$NJ8>O$G$9!#<ESC>H

Note the correspondence between the ASCII characters and Japanese characters, 
namely that two ASCII characters represent one Japanese character; hence, 
Japanese characters consist of two bytes. For example, the hiragana symbol for 
"RE" (れ) is represented by the two ASCII characters "$" and "l."
     The following paragraph is a sample Japanese text in the New-JIS Japanese 
code. If you are using a Japanese terminal, then you can view this Japanese 
text on-line using the procedures found in later sections of this report.

  New-JIS: (kanji-in: "<ESC>$B"; kanji-out: "<ESC>(J")
  　日本語の一文字を7ビットx2バイトのコードで表現する方法には新JIS、旧JIS、

     The following table lists the code specifications for the 7-bit codes and 
their respective escape sequences. This information is most useful to 
programmers.

                 DECIMAL            OCTAL              HEXADECIMAL
  first byte     033-126            041-176            21-7E
  second byte    033-126            041-176            21-7E

  New-JIS (1983):
   kanji-in      027 + 036 + 066    033 + 044 + 102    1B + 24 + 42
   kanji-out     027 + 040 + 074    033 + 050 + 112    1B + 28 + 4A
  Old-JIS (1978):
   kanji-in      027 + 036 + 064    033 + 044 + 100    1B + 24 + 40
   kanji-out     027 + 040 + 074    033 + 050 + 112    1B + 28 + 4A
  NEC-JIS:
   kanji-in      027 + 075          033 + 113          1B + 4B
   kanji-out     027 + 072          033 + 110          1B + 48


PART 2: 8-BIT JAPANESE CODES
     These codes cannot be used reliably through electronic mail networks 
since 7-bit paths will strip off the 8th bit leaving garbage. These codes are 
used primarily for internal processing of Japanese. For example, the Japanese 
system software for the Macintosh uses Shift-JIS code internally. The names in 
the parentheses below are other names for the same code (i.e., Shift-JIS is 
also called MS KANJI).

EXAMPLES:
  Shift-JIS (MS KANJI)
  EUC (AT&T JIS)

Shift-JIS:
     The Shift-JIS implementation is quite unlike that of the 7-bit code as 
described above. The two-byte-per-character mode is initiated when a Japanese 
terminal receives a character with a decimal value ranging between 129-159 or 
224-239. This character will subsequently be treated as the first byte of an 
expected two-byte sequence. The following character (the second byte) must be 
a character with a decimal value ranging between 64-158 (but not 127 -- the 
DEL character) or 159-252. Note that the first byte's range falls entirely in 
the extended ASCII character set -- true 8-bit characters. The second byte 
does not share the same limitation, though. Note that Shift-JIS includes half-
size katakana. Historically, this is how Shift-JIS got its name: the encoding 
for 2-byte kanji had to *shift* around the code positions for half-size 
katakana -- the half-size katakana existed first.
     The following table lists the code specifications for Shift-JIS. Note 
that all five types together make up Shift-JIS. This information is most 
useful to programmers.

                 DECIMAL            OCTAL              HEXADECIMAL
  TYPE 1:
   first byte    129-159            201-237            81-9F
   second byte   064-158 (not 127)  100-236 (not 177)  40-9E (not 7F)
  TYPE 2:
   first byte    224-239            340-357            E0-EF
   second byte   064-158 (not 127)  100-236 (not 177)  40-9E (not 7F)
  TYPE 3:
   first byte    129-159            201-237            81-9F
   second byte   159-252            237-374            9F-FC
  TYPE 4:
   first byte    224-239            340-357            E0-EF
   second byte   159-252            237-374            9F-FC
  Half-size katakana:
   first byte    161-223            241-337            A1-DF

     The following is a sample Japanese text in Shift-JIS code which has been 
uuencoded (so that it does not get corrupted on the nets). You can view this 
Japanese text by copying it, then uudecoding it.

EUC (Extended UNIX Code):
     EUC consists of 4 code sets, the primary code set (code set 0) which is 
the ASCII 7-bit character set, and 3 supplementary code sets (code sets 1, 2, 
and 3) which can be specified by the user, and are usually used for non-
English characters.
     The following table lists the code specifications for code set 1 of EUC. 
This information is most useful to programmers.

                 DECIMAL            OCTAL              HEXADECIMAL
  first byte     161-254            241-376            A1-FE
  second byte    161-254            241-376            A1-FE

     Code set 2 is used for half-size katakana, and code set 3 is used for 
GAIJI (外字 = external characters). Below are the code specifications for code 
sets 2 and 3; note that code set 3 uses three bytes per character.

                 DECIMAL            OCTAL              HEXADECIMAL
  Half-size katakana:
    first byte   142                216                8E
    second byte  161-223            241-337            A1-DF

  GAIJI:
    first byte   143                217                8F
    second byte  161-254            241-376            A1-FE
    third byte   161-254            241-376            A1-FE

     There will be no further discussion of the 8-bit Japanese codes. The 
important thing is that they exist, and can be manipulated electronically.
     The following is a sample Japanese text in EUC code which has been 
uuencoded (so that it does not get corrupted on the nets). You can view this 
Japanese text by copying the entire text, and uudecoding it.

PART 3: SENDING JAPANESE
     There are different environments under which one can send Japanese text 
from their computer to a mainframe computer for transmission through 
electronic mail. Many of these environments are specific to particular types 
of mainframe computers or electronic services.

PART 3.1: SENDING JAPANESE UNDER UNIX
     I have some experience in sending Japanese from UNIX mainframe computers. 
One method I know of is to upload the Japanese file using a standard file 
transfer protocol (like XModem or Kermit), then send it as an electronic mail 
message. The file's kanji code can be converted to New- or Old-JIS either 
before sending to the UNIX mainframe, or after it is there. One can also 
create Japanese text on-line if the user has such software.

PART 3.2: SENDING JAPANESE UNDER VMS
     VMS Vax machines can use a program which is executed with the command 
KANJI at the system prompt ($). This program simply allows the unprintable 
ASCII control character <ESC> (escape) to be accepted by VMS Vax machines. The 
output of the program is a file which is called OUTPUT.DAT. I can supply the 
code to users of VMS Vax machines upon request.

  STEP 1: $ [KANJI<CR>]
          (opens VMS Vax for Japanese input)
  STEP 2: (transfer text from paste buffer or from disc file)
  STEP 3: [<CR>.<CR>]
          (exits 'KANJI' and creates file OUTPUT.DAT)
  STEP 4: $ [EMAIL<CR>]
          (enters electronic mail system)
  STEP 5: EMail> [SEND OUTPUT.DAT<CR>]
          To: [address<CR>]
          Subject: [header<CR>]
          (file named OUTPUT.DAT is sent to the addressee)

     Another method is to use the Kermit file transfer protocol to transfer 
the file to the VMS mainframe. Japanese code conversion programs can 
subsequently convert the file's code to one which is more suitable for 
transmission by electronic mail. These programs, which can run on a mainframe 
or personal computer, are described in PART 5.

PART 3.3: SENDING JAPANESE UNDER COMPUSERVE
     CompuServe users can use an option in the MAIL system which allows one to 
upload a file from their personal computer to be sent as an electronic mail 
message. Since one cannot run their own programs on CompuServe, the user must 
convert their Japanese file to New-JIS (or Old-JIS) before transferring the 
file to CompuServe. Note that the Japanese text won't appear properly in the 
editor, but is readable if sent -- try to send Japanese text to yourself as an 
experiment. One can also upload a file to the PER area (personal file area for 
storing textfiles).
     Note that CompuServe users can send electronic mail to Internet 
addresses, and Internet users can send electronic mail to CompuServe 
addresses. CompuServe users must use the following template for sending to an 
Internet address:

Internet address:                     lunde@adobe.com
Addressing template on CompuServe:    >INTERNET:lunde@adobe.com

Internet users must use the following template for sending to a CompuServe 
address:

CompuServe user ID:                   00000,0000
Addressing template on the Internet:  00000.0000@compuserve.com

Note the use of the comma in the CompuServe user ID, and the use of the period 
in the Internet address. Be aware that the maximum file size which CompuServe 
users can receive is 50K. If you send anything larger, it must be segmented.
     The following does not pertain to CompuServe, but may still be useful 
information. AppleLink, another electronic service, has special email 
addressing requirements. For example, if someone on the Internet wishes to 
send email to someone on Applelink, the following pattern is used:

Applelink user ID:                    username
Addressing template on the Internet:  username@applelink.apple.com

The reverse pattern is as follows:

Internet address:                     lunde@adobe.com
Addressing template on AppleLink:     lunde@adobe.com@INTERNET#

Note that "INTERNET#" must be in all caps, and that two @'s are used in the 
addressing template. Be aware that AppleLink users cannot receive files more 
than 32K in size, and such files should be segmented before sending.


PART 4: RECEIVING JAPANESE
     Receiving Japanese text is a bit easier than sending it as you will find 
out below. Whether Japanese text will be displayed on-line depends on whether 
you computer and/or communication software has the ability to display 
Japanese. The mainframe computer simply stores the electronic codes, and your 
computer acting as a terminal will interpret them accordingly.

PART 4.1: RECEIVING JAPANESE UNDER VMS
     There are two methods for viewing Japanese text on VMS mainframe 
computers: the first method allows one to view Japanese while in the EMail 
subprogram; the second method allows one to view Japanese at the system 
prompt.

METHOD 1:

  STEP 1: open message containing Japanese
          (only ASCII characters can appear at this stage)
  STEP 2: EMail> [EXTRACT tt:<CR>]
          (converts message to textfile format and prints it on the screen)
          (Japanese text will now appear on-line)

METHOD 2:

  STEP 1: open message containing Japanese
          (only ASCII characters can appear at this stage)
  STEP 2: EMail> [EXTRACT filename<CR>]
          (converts message to textfile format)
  STEP 3: EMail> [EXIT<CR>]
          (exits electronic mail system)
  STEP 4: $ [TYPE filename.TXT<CR>]
          (Japanese text will appear on-line)

     The reason for this elaborate scheme is due to the VMS Vax mail sub- 
system's feature which does not permit control characters (like <ESC>) to 
perform their function; they are there, but only appear as a white space. Once 
the message is in textfile format, the control characters can function 
properly.

PART 4.2: RECEIVING JAPANESE UNDER UNIX/COMPUSERVE
     CompuServe and the UNIX mail system allows escape characters to function 
properly, so these users can read Japanese text on-line just like normal 
English text as long as their terminal allows Japanese to be displayed.

     For those who must view Japanese text off-line due to hardware/software 
limitations, then some sort of file transfer protocol (XModem or Kermit) must 
be used to get the file to where it can be viewed. If your viewer requires the 
file to be in Shift-JIS format, then the programs which are described in the 
following part will become important. Step 4 in the above scheme should be 
ignored, and is replaced with the downloading of the file to your computer. 
CompuServe users will need to save the message as a file in their PER area, 
then download it to their computer.


PART 5: CONVERSION OF JAPANESE CODES
     I have written a program in both C and Pascal which allows a user to 
change the Japanese codes within a textfile. They can handle Shift-JIS and EUC 
(both 8-bit Japanese codes), and all three 7-bit Japanese codes (New-JIS, Old-
JIS, and NEC-JIS).
     There are two Pascal versions of the program available: one for 
compilation on MS-DOS machines (Turbo Pascal), and another for compilation on 
VMS Vax machines (Vax Pascal). The source code along with a help file is 
available for downloading from the following anonymous FTP site:

  ucdavis.edu (128.120.2.1) (in the pub/JIS/PASCAL directory)

  jis.pas      <- source code for Vax Pascal
  jis_pc.pas   <- source code for Turbo Pascal
  jis.hlp      <- help file

I find this program to be a very useful tool. It was a standard piece of 
software running on the WIRCS cluster (VMS) at this university, but now the C 
version is being used. I have provided the source code so that other 
programmers may benefit from the algorithms to convert between the various 
Japanese codes. The Pascal version of this program has not been modified for 
over a year-and-a-half.
     This program has been recently rewritten in ANSI C, and should compile 
with no changes on any C compiler as long as it complies with the ANSI C 
standard. My intent is to make this program very portable across various 
platforms. I have also made significant changes in this version: improved 
error checking, the ability to automatically detect the input file's kanji 
code, selective conversion of half-size katakana to their full-size 
equivalents, and command-line argument support. The most current version as of 
this writing is JIS.C V2.1. This program is available at the same FTP site as 
the Pascal versions (above).

  ucdavis.edu (128.120.2.1) (in the pub/JIS/C directory)

  jis.c        <- source code for ANSI C compilers (instructions in header)

     If you have problems obtaining these programs, please feel free to 
contact me directly for a copy. I will be constantly upgrading the C version 
(jis.c), so simply check the FTP site periodically to see if a newer version 
is there (check the date posted column), or ask me directly.
     I was made aware of a program written by Mr. Itaru Ichikawa of Fujitsu 
(ichikawa%flab.fujitsu.co.jp@uunet.uu.net) called NKF (Network Kanji Filter). 
This program is very similar to the above programs, and is written in C. It 
was written to run under UNIX, but I also heard that an MS-DOS port of the 
program exists. I have obtained a copy of this program, and I have put a copy 
of it in the same directory as my jis.c program.

  ucdavis.edu (128.120.2.1) (in the pub/JIS/C directory)

  nkf.src       <- source code for NKF
  nkf.patch     <- patch for NKF

     For those who wish to convert Japanese files on the Macintosh, there are 
three programs available, each of which can be requested by email through me. 
One is called MacKc 0.93. It is an application written by Mr. Masato Hirose 
(hirose%sws.cpd.mei.co.jp@uunet.uu.net), and is available at the FTP site 
given below. MacKc 0.93 is much like ASL KConvert (below), but it can *
automatically* detect the input file's Japanese code (it supports Shift-JIS, 
EUC, 2 types of New-JIS, and 2 types of Old-JIS), and allows one to rename the 
output file. It has many other nice features built-in. It also allows one to 
modify how lines break. Unlike ASL KConvert, it uses a Finder-like interface. 
This program is FreeWare.
     The second is called ASL KConvert 1.0/a3 (in both application and desk 
accessory (DA) form). This program was written by Mr. Hiroo Yamada 
(76414.372@compuserve.com), and is available at FTP at the site given below. 
The file must be debinhexed and unstuffed. It handles New-JIS (does not 
recognize <ESC>(B, though), Old-JIS (two types), Shift-JIS, EUC, and another 
code called DEC. This program also allows one to change how lines break, 
namely by carriage return, line feed, or a combination of both. This program 
is FreeWare.
	The third is a Macintosh port of my JIS.C program described above. This 
program, of course, is FreeWare, and includes the source code. Please write to 
me to request a copy.


PART 6: JAPANESE ELECTRONIC MAIL NETWORKS AND ADDRESSING TEMPLATES
     There are two electronic mail networks which are used in Japan: JUNET 
(Japan UNIX Network) and BITNET (also called CREN).
     JUNET addresses are rather complicated, and will differ depending on 
whether the address is a corporation or not. Here is a typical Japanese 
address as used in Japan:

  tomita@keio.ac.jp

     Since this address is for an academic institution (ac), it will use the 
following addressing template (note the use of % and @):

  tomita%keio.ac.jp@relay.cs.net

     An address such as tomita@canon.co.jp is a corporation, so its addressing 
template is as follows (again, note the use of % and @):

  tomita%canon.co.jp@uunet.uu.net

     The rule of thumb is that you should use the ...%...@uunet.uu.net 
addressing template when sending to a corporation, but otherwise you should 
use ...%...@relay.cs.net. The use of % and @ indicates use of relays.

NOTE: It is no longer necessary to use relays (relay.cs.net or uunet.uu.net) 
to get electronic mail from the United States to Japan. You may, however, 
notice that encoded Japanese text will become scrambled if the relay is 
omitted from the address. I think this is caused by the mail somehow getting 
onto Bitnet along the way, and then the escape characters are removed. In any 
case, if you experience problems with sending Japanese text without using a 
relay in the address, you will find that using the relay should solve the 
problem.

     There are currently 93 BITNET nodes in Japan. Besides JUNET and the now 
developing Japanese Internet (WIDE), there is still an increasing demand for 
membership in BITNET.
     I have experienced problems when sending or receiving Japanese text to 
BITNET addresses. Sending to JUNET addresses is much more reliable. The 
problem with BITNET lies in the fact that those unprintable ASCII escape 
characters are removed far too often. I have, however, found out that escape 
codes do survive when sent as network files (network files are not considered 
to be electronic mail messages since there is no header; it is simply sending 
a file from site to site by electronic means). To send a Japanese network file 
to a bitnet host, use the following format:

  SEND/FILE/BINARY/TRANSLATE/PRINTER filename address

/PRINTER is usually required when sending files whose lines are longer than 80 
characters. Escape sequences add data to a line although they are invisible 
when printed; lines may wrap at unexpected places if this part is omitted from 
the command.
     I have noticed that BITNET seems to handle 8-bit codes in electronic mail 
messages much better than Internet (or JUNET) does. One simply needs to 
experiment with the site they wish to contact.
     BITNET addresses are the same as in the US, namely that the following 
addressing template can be used:

  username@JPN*****

Note that Japanese BITNET sites begin with the three letters JPN.

SEE APPENDIX 1 FOR BITNET NODES IN JAPAN

     Although there is no direct way to send email from the Internet to 
NiftyServe, a very popular Japanese Bulletin Board Service (BBS), there exists 
a gateway between NiftyServe and CompuServe. CompuServe users can enter GO 
NIFTY at any ! prompt to connect to NiftyServe. There are several things to 
note before doing this: 1) CompuServe charges about $12 per hour on-line costs 
-- accessing NiftyServe through this gateway, I am told, increases the charge 
to about $35 per hour; and 2) CompuServe requires 7E1 for communications 
settings -- NiftyServe requires 8N1 -- this means one must be able to change 
their communications settings while still connected. I hope to include more 
such information on accessing Japanese electronic services in future versions 
of JAPAN.INF.


PART 7: ACTIVE JUNET DOMAINS
     JUNET is by far the most active electronic mail network in Japan. There 
are 5 domains within JUNET: AC, GO, OR, AD, and CO. These correspond to 
Academic Institution (AC), Government (GO), Organization (OR), Administration 
(AD), and Corporation (CO), respectively.
     The basic addressing method works like described in Part 6, but each 
domain must be specified within the address. For example, "hokudai", which is 
in the AC domain, is addressed as "hokudai.ac.jp". The JP domain, which is 
JUNET itself, is much simpler; for example, "ntt" would be "ntt.jp".

SEE APPENDIX 2 FOR JUNET DOMAINS


PART 8: JUNET NEWS
     JUNET News is the Japanese equivalent to the Usenet NEWS. Each newsgroup 
name is prefixed with fj, which means "From Japan."
     JUNET News is an information service which contains many newsgroups. It 
acts much like a bulletin board in Japan, but is distributed in the United 
States using electronic mail (not all newsgroups are available in this 
electronic mail distribution, though). The articles posted to JUNET News are 
in Japanese, and are in either Old-JIS or New-JIS code.
     To subscribe to the JUNET News mailing list, simply send a request to Mr. 
Hisao Nojima at nojima%nttlab.ntt.jp@relay.cs.net or to Stanford University at 
junet-news-request@russell.stanford.edu. You will then receive a *grab bag* of 
articles from a limited list of newsgroup.
     If you only wish to receive a select few newsgroups, please send a 
request to Jason Molenda at molenda@s1.msi.umn.edu instead. Please do not ask 
Jason Molenda to send you several newsgroups as this will clog the mailers -- 
I am currently receiving only fj.sys.mac and fj.lang.postscript from him. The 
following is information about receiving JUNET News articles (written by Jason 
Molenda):

1)   With rrn (remote rn), you can read the newsgroups from my systems via 
NNTP (Network News Transmission Protocol or some such thing) right on our 
system. This is usually the easiest way; any user can do it, you don't need 
root-access on your system to set this up.
     There are also remote news readers that use GNU Emacs. There are also 
remote news readers for just about any computer in the known Universe out 
there; Mac, VAX, I think even PC's.

2)   Physically telnet into the NNTP port and interact with the nntp daemon 
directly. This can be done but it's not very fun.... A sample session would 
look like

group fj.general
article
next
article
group fj.kanji

etc. It's all pretty gross; not really meant for humans to do. I wouldn't 
recommend it unless you're desperate.

3)   Get a newsfeed of the fj.* newsgroups. This is by far the easiest from my 
point of view. Although there are about 150 or so fj.* newsgroups, the volume 
is pretty low (compared to comp and rec), so if you're not the news admin at 
your site, it may be easy to convince him/her to set up the newsfeed for them. 
Then you would be able to read the newsgroups locally on your own machine and 
post messages, etc.

4)   I can also have my news system mail you the articles fairly painlessly. 
This isn't too great because you'll end up with 200-300 articles per day in 
your mailbox.

SEE APPENDIX 3 FOR JUNET NEWS NEWSGROUPS


PART 9: HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
     The basic necessity for sending and receiving Japanese text using 
electronic mail is a Japanese terminal. A mainframe computer itself does not 
give you the ability to display Japanese text, but only stores the raw code 
along with its escape sequences. Below are some suggestions for obtaining a 
Japanese terminal. I am sure there are others, and I will include them once I 
find them.

GENERAL MAINFRAMES
     There is an interesting piece of software called KanjiBanner with which 
one can display Japanese on any terminal, if your mainframe host computer has 
the file called k14.bdf or k16.bdf installed. The author's name is Koichi 
Yasuoka (安岡孝一), and his email address is yasuoka%kudpc.kyoto-
u.ac.jp@relay.cs.net. I have not tried this program, though.


NeXT
     The following is a message from Mr. Izumi Ohzawa directed toward NeXT 
users:

--- BEGIN ---
Dear NeXT users --
  who use Japanese at work
  who are studying or learning Japanese
  who teach Japanese
  who are native Japanese working/studying abroad, and internationally-minded 
NeXT developers who want to plan ahead product development for Japanese, 
Chinese, and Korean markets.
     I have volunteered to set up a mailing list "next-nihongo" to exchange 
information and ideas on using Japanese on the NeXT computer.
     If you wish to be added to, or removed from this mailing list, send e-
mail to: "next-nihongo-request@pinoko.berkeley.edu".
     If you wish to send mails to *everyone* on the mailing list, send e-mail 
to: "next-nihongo@pinoko.berkeley.edu". [Please, please, DO NOT send requests 
to the mailing-list manager, namely "next-nihongo."]
     The installed user base of the NeXT computer is still quite small, and 
the number of users who are interested in using Japanese on NeXT is even 
smaller. I am hoping that this list will help us at the initial stage of the 
development of the NeXT user community. Additionally, we should be able to 
lobby NeXT and Canon (the NeXT distributor for Asia) so that they provide us 
with the Japanese version of the NeXT OS at a reasonable cost outside of Japan 
as soon as possible.
     The Japanese version of the NeXT OS (2.1J) apparently started shipping in 
Japan just a few weeks ago (July 91). Although I have not played with it 
myself, it appears to offer the best Japanese language environment of all 
workstation-class computers. The educational price of the NeXT even compares 
favorably with Macs when the cost of Kanji PostScript printer is included (and 
if the OS is offered at a reasonable price).

UNIX
     For those of you who are using UNIX, there are options open for you, too. 
kterm is used by UNIX, and works under the X WINDOW system. There is also a 
Japanese Front-End Processor called Wnn. Nemacs (written by Ken'ichi Handa of 
ETL) and nepoch at site scslwide.sony.co.jp (133.138.199.1) are Japanese text 
editors. Some people prefer jstevie. For printing purposes, jTeX (ASCII and 
NTT versions) and kanjips are useful.
     Wnn is a Japanese front-end processor which runs under UNIX (a Macintosh 
version is due out soon). The name Wnn is from the project objective to make a 
good Kana-to-Kanji conversion program which can convert "Watashino Namae ha 
Nakano desu" into correct Japanese on the first try. Wnn version 4.0.3 is 
available at the utsun.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp (133.11.11.11) FTP archive in the fj/
wnn4.0.3 directory. The following article (in English) gives an overview of 
Wnn: KABA Software Research Group: Overview of GMW+Wnn System, 2nd IEEE 
Conference on Computer Workstations (1988), pp. 170-177.
     There is a public domain vi-based editor named JSTEVIE which supports 
most vi and ex commands, Japanese kanji input, tag stack, etc. It runs mainly 
on UNIX and MS-DOS systems, and should be easy to port to other platforms. As 
you can tell from its name, it is based on the STEVIE 3.69 sources by Tony 
Andrews. Hopefully, these two threads will be merged someday into a single 
distribution.

Features of JSTEVIE include:
  - Japanese kanji support - works with JIS, EUC, SJIS codes and with most
    MS-DOS front-end processors
  - shiftwidth, autowrite, and fepcontrol settings
  - tag stack (cf. Sun's vi) for returning to previous context after using
    :ta or ^[ commands
  - :map, :map!, :ab, :unmap, :unmap!, and :unab are supported
  - uses TERMCAP file for terminal settings

The latest version of JSTEVIE (J1.2) is available by anonymous FTP at site 
utsun.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp (133.11.7.250). It is also available at site 
mindseye.berkely.edu (128.32.232.19) in the pub/kanji directory under the name 
jstevie.tar.Z. Any questions about JSTEVIE should be sent to its author, Jun 
Ohta, at ohta%src.ricoh.co.jp@uunet.uu.net.
     Nemacs (Nihongo Emacs) is a Japanese language editor based on GNU Emacs. 
It runs under a system in which GNU Emacs runs, and distributed in the form of 
patches to GNU Emacs or the previous version of Nemacs. Nemacs can handle 
kanji and kana characters in a buffer, and displays them on the screen. File 
I/O, interprocess communication, screen display, and keyboard input are all 
specially designed for handling Japanese character codes: JIS, Shift-JIS, and 
EUC. TAMAGO supplies the Japanese text environment for Nemacs. TAMAGO requires 
the kana-to-kanji conversion server Wnn V3.3 or later. The latest version is 
TAMAGO Ver.3.0.0. TAMAGO enables one to input Japanese characters, and edit 
Japanese text in a Nemacs buffer. By default, roman characters are used to 
input kana, and then the kana are converted into kanji, but you can customize 
TAMAGO to accept direct kana or kanji input. TAMAGO also extends Emacs' text 
editing functions for fill/justify and search/replace, or adds new ones to fit 
the Japanese writing system. TAMAGO (means "egg" in Japanese) is an 
abbreviation of TAKUSAN MATASETE GOMEN NASAI (沢山待たせてごめんなさい), 
"sorry to have kept you waiting so long." The latest version of Nemacs and 
TAMAGO is available by anonymous FTP at several sites: clover.ucdavis.edu 
(128.120.57.1), cs.washington.edu or june.cs.washington.edu (128.95.1.4), 
sauna.hut.fi (130.233.192.1), russell.stanford.edu (36.9.0.9), mtfuji.gw.u-
tokyo.ac.jp (128.167.64.2), utsun.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp (133.11.11.11), and 
ftp.cs.titech.ac.jp (131.112.16.39). Any questions or suggestions about nemacs 
or TAMAGO should be sent to nemacs@etl.go.jp or tamago@etl.go.jp.
     Kanji printing programs are now available via anonymous ftp from /usr/
masui/ftp at site a.nl.cs.cmu.edu (128.2.250.143). The kit consists of 3 
programs: 1) kanjips - converts a PostScript program including JIS Kanji text 
into normal PostScript text by expanding each Kanji character into a dot 
pattern; 2) jenscript - convert a plain text including Kanji into a Kanji 
Postscript file; and 3) mp - convert a mail/news article into a Kanji 
PostScript file. Kanjips can handle many kinds of Kanji pattern files, such as 
1) Pxl/pk files used in JTeX (jisjka24, etc.); 2) X11 bdf files (k14, k24, 
etc.); 3) GMW pattern files; and 4) Plain dot-matrix pattern files. Sample 
usage:

% jenscript kanjifile | kanjips | lpr -Plw
-- prints a Japanese textfile

% show | mp | kanjips | lpr -Plw
-- prints mail containing Japanese

     The following is a description of kterm. A new version of kterm is now 
available from the following anonymous ftp sites: crl.nmsu.edu (128.123.1.14) 
as pub/misc/kterm-4.1.2.tar.Z; expo.lcs.mit.edu (18.30.0.212) as contrib/
kterm-4.1.2.tar.Z; and kum.kaist.ac.kr (137.68.1.65) as pub/x/kterm-
4.1.2.tar.Z. Version 4.1.2 supports Chinese (GuoBiao (7 && 8-bit), Big5 , and 
Shift-GuoBiao text), Japanese (EUC, Shift-JIS, and JIS text), Korean (KS 
C5601-1987 Hangul and n-byte Hangul text), ISO 6429 color text sequences, and 
X11 Compound Text character set sequences (Not all of the character sets are 
supported, but the sequences are recognized.) The README file mentions 
anonymous ftp locations for Chinese, Japanese, and Korean Hangul BDF fonts. 
Please send bug reports, fixes, enhancements, etc. to Mark Leisher at 
mleisher@nmsu.edu.
     The following is a description of using Japanese on UNIX written by Frank 
Sheeran. Some of the material is slightly repeated from above paragraphs, 
though. There are several pieces of software that allow use of Japanese at 
various levels under UNIX, if you are using X11 windowing environment. If you 
are not using X11, you are probably out of luck. In short, X11 allows programs 
("clients") on any internet computer to be used much like a MacIntosh or a 
Windows program, right on your screen, with graphics. Xterm is the standard 
terminal emulation program. If you know xterm, kterm the same, only it uses 
JIS fonts. It automatically follows shifts between ASCII and JIS formats, and 
is fine by itself for reading mail. Many sizes of fonts are available. Since X 
terminals usually have big screens and high resolution, a 16 point font is 
fine for general use, if you only want to use one. Kterm also displays Korean 
and Chinese, if you have the requisite Hangul/Hanzi fonts. Kinput captures 
input, uses Wnn (like a meat grinder - ASCII in, JIS out) to convert to kanji, 
then sends the JIS codes on their merry way. Depending on your task, then, 
your X11 system will need:

                     JIS fonts   jtex   kterm   kinput   wnn   nemacs/jstevie
                     ^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^   ^^^^^   ^^^^^^   ^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Viewing:             yes                yes
Printing:                        yes
Terminal emulation:  yes                yes     yes      yes
Editing:             yes                        maybe    yes   yes


IBM/IBM Compatibles (MS-DOS)
     There is a program which allows any IBM or clone (USA type) to read (but 
not to send) incoming Japanese text. I have tried it, and it works fairly 
well. It does require some sort of graphics, the basic necessary being 
Hercules. To obtain a copy, contact Mr. Seiichi Nomura (b470ssn@utarlvm1).
     MOKE (Mark's Own Kanji Editor) version 2.0 is a Japanese editor written 
by Mr. Mark Edwards. It allows one to create Japanese text for sending by 
electronic mail. It can also be used for displaying Japanese text. I recommend 
it highly for MS-DOS users; the only alternative is EW+, which costs $850.00. 
MOKE 2.0 costs $49.95 plus $5.00 for shipping and handling (an additional 
$5.00 for foreign addresses). MOKE 2.0 can be used in conjunction with 
communication software, such as PROCOMM or Kermit, for sending/receiving 
Japanese text. MOKE 2.0 can be ordered from the following address (specify 
either 3.5" or 5.25" disks):
 
  KiCompWare
  Attn: J.J.
  1812 N. Erb St.
  Appleton, WI 54911

In case personal contact with the author is required, his address in Japan is 
as follows (DO NOT use this address for ordering MOKE 2.0!):

Mark Edwards
#405 Konya manshon 4-12-6 Gono kami
Hamura-cho, Nishitamagun
Tokyo 190
JAPAN
Phone: (0425)79-3910

Mr. Edwards can also be contacted at 101015.206@compuserve.com.
     KD (Kanji Driver) is a program written by Mr. Izumi Ohzawa of University 
of California-Berkeley. He can be contacted at izumi@violet.berkeley.edu. KD 
is available through anonymous FTP at mindseye.berkeley.edu (128.32.232.19) 
(in the pub/kanji directory). KD supports both JIS levels (6,355 kanji), and 
Japanese files may be displayed on-line (one does not have to download a file 
for viewing off-line). KD is written in Turbo C and runs on all graphic 
adapters. KD, which comes with dmore, can also be run using the Kermit 
terminal program.
     There is also a Japanese terminal program called hterm (version 2.6.0.0), 
available free for non-military use at FTP site azabu.tkl.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp 
(130.69.16.7) in the hterm/hterm2.6.0.0 directory. It is a full fledged 
terminal program that allows one to view Japanese on line on American-made 
IBM/PC's with EGA or VGA. It emulates VT220. It also contains a program called 
hemacs, with which one can read Shift-JIS Japanese files up to 800 lines long, 
and can edit the file a bit (no FEP support, though). It comes in a huge 
package (500K+), and the source code is available at the same site. I was told 
that this version may be corrupted, and that version 2.6.0.-2, one which 
works, is available at terminator.cc.umich.edu (141.211.164.8).
     The newest arrival for the MS-DOS world is called IBM DOS J4.0/V. It is a 
Japanese operating system for MS-DOS computers, and is IBM's answer to 
KanjiTalk for the Macintosh. It is similar to KanjiTalk in that its Japanese 
fonts are stored in RAM rather than in ROM. This allows non-Japanese MS-DOS 
machines (i.e., those sold in the US) to implement Japanese. The following are 
the hardware requirements to run IBM DOS J4.0/V:

  - AT/PS2 compatible with VGA graphics
  - 80286 or above CPU
  - At least 256K of extended memory (NOT expanded memory 'EMS')
  - Extended keyboard with at least 101 keys
  - 3.5 inch 1.44MB floppy disk drive

The operating system costs 40,000 Yen (the manuals are extra!). I hear that it 
is available in Japan right now, and that there are plans to market it in the 
US early in 1991. Note that the Paradise VGA professional and the 
ProDesignerII VGA cards do not work with this operating system.
     Shouichi Matsui of the Central Research Institute of Electric Power 
Industry wrote a utility program to print Japanese text from the IBM PC to the 
HP Laserjet series printers. It uses 24x24 JIS fonts which you can download 
from the utsun server (133.11.11.11) and comes with C source code. The output 
is reasonable and fast. This program is available to the public and it will be 
uploaded to appropriate FTP servers. In the meantime, if you want a copy (not 
the JIS 24x24 fonts, which are about 500K), send Seiichi Nomura 
(b460nom@utarlg.uta.edu) or Shouichi Matsui (matsui%denken.or.jp@relay.cs.net) 
a message and you will get the uuencoded file.


MACINTOSH (マッキントッシュ)
     The Macintosh is probably the best computer you can buy (at least in the 
US) if you wish to use Japanese in the things you do.
     NinjaTerm, a public domain Japanese communications program written by Mr. 
Michiharu Ariza of Adobe Japan, used to be available from sumex-
aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6) by anonymous FTP. It was recently removed to free 
up disk space there. I will gladly send a copy to anyone who wants it. 
NinjaTerm can send and receive text in New-JIS and Old-JIS; it also supports 
Shift-JIS and EUC for other applications. NinjaTerm requires KanjiTalk version 
1.0 or higher (the most current version is 6.0.7).
     For Macintoshes with TCP/IP, FastPath, GatorBox, etc., NCSA TelnetJ works 
fine as a Japanese terminal emulator. It is located at the FTP site utsun.s.u-
tokyo.ac.jp (133.11.11.11) in the Mac/telnetJ directory. This is the Japanese 
version of NCSA Telnet. ASLTelnet, from the author of ASLEdit+, also works 
very well, and can be used for the same purposes. I can send copies by 
request.
     KanjiTalk version 6.0.7 can be obtained through APDA (800-282-2732 or 
APDA@applelink.apple.com) for $70 (plus $20 for one-year membership) in the 
near future. It will come with 9 disks, and its stock number is M0008J/C. You 
will need at least 2MB RAM and a hard disk to make this system work properly. 
Unfortunately, APDA currently sells only KanjiTalk 6.0.4. Note that APDA 
members are eligible to subscribe to a quarterly journal called "develop," and 
that each issue of "develop" includes a CD-ROM on which is the most current 
version of KanjiTalk, namely KanjiTalk 6.0.7. A one-year subscription to 
"develop" is $30, and sample issues are sold for $10 each.
     In order to input (create) Japanese text on a Macintosh, you will need to 
be running Japanese system software, namely KanjiTalk (see above). You will 
also need a front-end processor (FEP) as well as an editor or word processor. 
An FEP is the tool which performs the so-called kana-to-kanji conversion, and 
an editor or word processor is simply the "blackboard" on which you write. Be 
aware that some blackboards are "smarter" than others -- MicroSoft Word does 
not handle Japanese properly, but Nisus does extremely well.
     An FEP called HENKAN 2.1 (2.0 for versions of KanjiTalk before 6.0.7) is 
included with KanjiTalk. There are other, more powerful, FEP's available, some 
of which are EGBridge 5.0, TurboJIP 2.0, Wnn, and MacVJE 2.1. I personally use 
MacVJE 2.1, and find it very powerful and flexible.
     There is a text editor called miniWRITER 1.7 which handles Japanese 
remarkably well. It is a DA (Desk Accessory), so it is accessible everywhere 
on the Macintosh. It handles Japanese beautifully, and is ShareWare ($12.00 
fee). It is available through anonymous FTP at the same site as NinjaTerm. You 
can find it as mini-writer-17.hqx in the info-mac/da directory. There is also 
another editor called ASLEdit+ 1.0/a12 written by Mr. Hiroo Yamada 
(76414.372@compuserve.com), but does not have a word wrap feature (it was 
designed to be an editor for source code). This program can be used as either 
a DA or application. This is also available at the sumex-aim.stanford.edu FTP 
archive in the info-mac/app directory under the name asledit-plus-10a12.hqx, 
is FreeWare, and has a very robust search/replace feature. The last text 
editor I would like to mention is YooEdit 0.95 written by Mr. Yooichi Tagawa. 
This program is much like ASLEdit+ above (it can be used as either a DA or 
application), but sports a word wrap feature which works best with Japanese, 
not English (it splits words randomly at the end of lines). It is FreeWare, 
and is available at the sumex-aim.stanford.edu FTP site (36.44.0.6) in the 
info-mac/app directory under the name yooedit-095.hqx. If any of these 
programs are not where I said they are, they can be requested directly from 
me.
     There are several Japanese word processors for the Macintosh: マックライ
トII-J (MacWriteII-J), EGWord, TurboWriter, MacWord, zeroByWord, ByWord, にば
いわーど (2ByWord), and Solo Writer. There are also Japanese DeskTop 
Publishing programs for the Macintosh: QuarkXPress 2.0J, Aldus PageMaker 3.5J, 
and EGBook. I use PageMaker 3.5J. There are US sources for these programs. 
Another Japanese word processor called BlueHawk is due out very soon. It is 
very cheap (3800 Yen!), and claims to support in-line conversion with any FEP. 
It will be marketed in Japan by Akiba Pascal, and I know of no US source.
     A localized Japanese version of Nisus (called Solo Writer) was released 
in May 1991. Its price in Japan is 68,000 Yen, and in the US is $495.00. 
Paragon Concepts, who wrote the program (Mercury Software markets it in Japan) 
tells me that registered users of Nisus can purchase Solo Writer for only 
$250.00. Educational discounts of $250 are also available for Solo Writer (USA 
only) as well as site licenses. Paragon Concepts and Mercury Software offer a 
demo disk for Solo Writer available free for the asking. Paragon Concepts can 
be reached by phone at 800-922-2993 or by email at d0405@applelink.apple.com 
for more information.
     A good source for Japanese-related products for the Macintosh is Qualitas 
Trading Company (6907 Norfolk Road, Berkeley, CA 94705, 415-848-8080). There 
is also an outfit called Japanese Language Services (186 Lincoln Street, 
Boston, MA 02111, PHONE: 617-338-2211, FAX: 617-338-4611) which markets 
Japanese software for the Macintosh. The Green Signal Factory in San 
Francisco, California (800-722-7795) also sells Japanese software for the 
Macintosh.
     KanjiTalk, of course, includes Japanese fonts. There are two basic types 
of Japanese fonts: Ming- (明朝) and Gothic- (ゴシック) style. Included in the 
package are PostScript screen fonts (requires the use of the LaserWriterII 
NTX-J for PostScript output) and ImageWriterII fonts. The following chart 
lists the fonts included with KanjiTalk 6.0.7:

PostScript Screen: 細明朝体 (Ming), 等幅明朝 (mono-spaced Ming), 中ゴシック体
                   (Gothic), 等幅ゴシック (mono-spaced Gothic)
ImageWriterII:     Kyoto (Ming), Osaka (Gothic)

Individuals in Japan have also designed their own fonts. All of these are 
ImageWriterII fonts, and have special characteristics. They are as follows:

ASLFont+    (9/12-point, Japanese is Osaka, English is Monaco, included with
             ASLEdit+, mono-spaced font)
Tokyo       (12/24-point, Japanese is Osaka, English is Chicago, no half-
             size katakana support, meant to be System font using
             SystemFontINIT)
Koshigaya   (9/12/18/24-point, Japanese is Osaka, English is Geneva, no
             half-size katakana support, meant to be Application font using
             SysFontINIT)
Yoshinogari (9/12-point, Japanese is Osaka, English is Geneva)
K2!         (9/12-point, Japanese is Osaka, English is Chicago, meant to be
             System and application font by using a utility such as
             KTCustomizer)

I use Tokyo as my System font, Koshigaya as my Application font, and ASLFont+ 
for most editing purposes. I have placed a file called japan-fonts.hqx on the 
sumex-aim.stanford.edu FTP site (36.44.0.6) in the info-mac/font directory. It 
includes the five Japanese fonts mentioned above (ASLFont+, Tokyo, Koshigaya, 
Yoshinogari, and K2!) along with an INIT called SysFontINIT which requires the 
use of the Tokyo and Koshigaya fonts.
     There are also third-party Japanese font vendors. Canon markets high-
resolution Japanese fonts in both Ming and Gothic styles, and in a wide 
variety of sizes ranging from 24- to 56-dots. The Ming style is available in 
32-, 40-, 48-, and 56-dot sizes, and the Gothic style is available in 24-, 
32-, 40-, 48-, and 56-dot sizes. 24- through 40-dot sizes cost 8,800 Yen each, 
and 48- through 56-dot sizes costs 9,800 Yen each. Japanese Language Services 
(address and phone number above) sells the Canon fonts in the US. Dynaware 
(the maker of MacVJE and MacWord) also markets scalable Japanese fonts 
(includes both Ming and Gothic fonts) called MacFont which sells for 20,000 
Yen. Both of the included fonts are designed to be used with LaserWriter-
series laser printers without the Japanese PostScript feature. This means that 
if you do not have a LaserWriterII NTX-J, and want 300 dpi (dots-per-inch) 
resolution, these fonts are for you. Ain Technology markets a product called 
Parametric Font  which costs 18,900 Yen ($150 through the Green Signal Factory 
in San Francisco, California -- phone number listed above). This product 
offers scalable screen fonts at a reasonable price, and allows the user to 
adjust their relative weight for both Ming- and Gothic-styles. This product 
requires the use of the 2 PostScript screen fonts included with KanjiTalk 
6.0.7.
     Adobe Systems Incorporated has just released 3 new Japanese PostScript 
typefaces: FutoMin (bold Ming), FutoGo (bold Gothic), and Jun (thin-rounded 
Gothic). They are downloadable, and will cost 99,000 Yen each.


DEDICATED JAPANESE WORD PROCESSORS (日本語ワープロ専用機)
     Many dedicated Japanese word processors are available with built-in 
modems, built-in communication software, or both.
     I once used an NEC 文豪ミニ7H (BUNGOU mini7H) with a built-in 1200 baud 
modem and communication software. I was able to send and receive text only in 
NEC-JIS, but by using my Japanese code conversion program described in PART 5, 
I was able to convert incoming codes and to convert outgoing codes to New-JIS 
with absolutely no difficulty. Other newer dedicated Japanese word processors 
handle New-JIS and other codes. Some of these machines can be purchased for as 
little as $500, but only in Japan.
     Be aware that these machines are not computers, have limited memory 
capacity, and cannot be serviced in the US. If you only use a computer as a 
word processor, then one of these machines may be an inexpensive alternative.
     I will try to include as part of the next version of JAPAN.INF a report 
on the current state-of-the-art of dedicated Japanese word processors. I am 
currently gathering the data I need to do so. Anyone with experience with such 
machines should send me their comments as soon as possible.


A FINAL NOTE
     I hope that the information presented here will prove useful. I would 
like to keep the electronic version of this article as up-to-date as possible, 
and through readers' input, I am able to do so.
     Most readers should notice that I am very heavy into the Macintosh. If 
anyone has information on Japanese interfaces for UNIX, VMS, or any other 
machine, please feel free to send me the information, and I will be sure to 
include it in the next version of JAPAN.INF. Your name, of course, will be 
mentioned in the ACKNOWLEDGMENTS section. Please include sources for the 
software/documentation by giving addresses, phone numbers, FTP sites (with 
their IP numbers!), etc.
     Please do not hesitate to ask me further question concerning any subject 
presented in this text.


ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

BIBLIOGRAPHY
     The following publications are very useful references for anyone who is 
interested in coding methods for Japanese text. All of the references are in 
Japanese, except for the paper I wrote, so you must have reading ability in 
order for these to be useful. JIS X 0212-1990 and Kazuo Tajima's book are 
excellent references for the additional 5,801 kanji made standard in 1990 
(Kazuo Tajima was the chairman of the JIS X 0212-1990 committee).
     I have included two lists. One is romanized, and the other is Japanese. 
The content of both lists is identical except for my paper. [NOTE: JIS =

   computers need different software to bevave IBM-like in BITNET
   UREP = UNIX
   JNET = VAX/VMS
   JES2 = MVS from IBM (dont't try to talk online with users there.
                        The machine is a batch-specialist and can't talk
                        to anybody outside)
   RSCS = VM from IBM
   NJE & NETDA = I hope sombody can tell me!!!
