-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1.19 DOS/V
      DOS/V allows non-Japanese PCs (i.e. PCs that does not have the Kanji
      fonts in ROM) to display and enter Japanese. The fonts and conversion
      tools are all software. The main caveat is: you cannot enter/display 
      Japanese in applications that were not designed for working with DOS/V 
      (like non-Japanese Lotus, Word, etc.) unless they can use ANSI.SYS to 
      display the characters. English-based applications must run on the
      English environment - there is a command to change between them.
      Other caveat: software designed for Japanese PCs, like NECs, will 
      not run on DOS/V. There seems to be also a problem with the printing - 
      Japanese will not work for printers that does not have the Kanji 
      fonts in their own ROMs too. The last version is J5.02/V. You need 
      also a VGA or better and at least 2 Mb of memory to run it. Price is 
      about 17.000 yen. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1.20 JLateX
      There are two freeware versions from LaTex available in some FTPs - I

      Now sources are part of Mule, q.v.  Binaries available at FTP sites:
      USA??? ftp.uu.net [192.48.96.9] directory 
        /systems/ibmpc/msdos/simtel20/demacs
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1.22 Word Perfect 5.1j
      WP5.1j works under DOS/V, but has its own FEP - WPFEP, which doesn't 
      require any extended memory. So to run WP you need only WPFEP.sys and
      about 400K conventional memory. To print texts from WP is a problem, 
      because it supports only japanese printers. Price: about 40.000 yens.
      Does anybody have more information on it ?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1.23 Kana Sensei v2.1

2.1.24 YKH
      YKH is a program for DOS that emulates a VT320 terminal while properly
      displaying Japanese text. It is able to connect via modem through
      comports 1 and 2, or over local-area networks using the DECNET LAT 
      and DECNET CTERM network terminal protocols. Unlike most Japanese 
      terminals, YKH is able to fix Japanese text that has been damaged by 
      escape-code stripping.
      YKH requires at least an 80286 CPU, the extended keyboard BIOS, a VGA
      graphics adapter, and about 128K of free RAM.
      It can be downloaded from FTP sites:
      USA: oak.oakland.edu, file /pub/msdos/modem/ykh122.zip

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.2.5 Windows 3.1/J
      There is a version of Windows that can run under DOS/V. You will need
      a 80386SX or better, 27+ Mb of hard disk, MS-DOS 5.0/V or IBM DOS 
      J5.02/V, at least 4 Mb Ram and VGA display. The Kanji fonts are 
      TrueType. The drivers are only for Japanese made printers, but if you
      have drivers for non-Japanese printers you can install them and they
      will print OK. US printers can be installed by replacing CONTROL.INF
      file in the system directory with the US version. Thus, even old U
      printers like EPSON FX (9 pin) can print Kanji TrueType fonts. You 
      might want to save a version of the Japanese CONTROL.INF. Non-Japanese
      versions of programs seem to work OK under Win31J, as long you don't
      expect to use Japanese on them. Win31J can coexist with English Win31. 
      They should be installed in separate directories, changing the path 
      environment variable changes which version is run. 
      [Rafael's note: I had some weird problems with non-japanese 
      applications which messages that should be in English appears in 
      Japanese, garbaged !]

2.2.6 Word for Windows 5.0/J
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.2.7 WinJDIC - Japanese Dictionary for Windows (WinJDIC), by KiCompWare
      The Japanese Dictionary project was started way back in 1990 by 
      Mark Edwards. Professor Jim Breen took it over and has continued 
      to support, compile, and edit it. He also wrote a DOS program JDIC
      to provide a quick interface to the program. Since then a version for
      the Mac, and X-Windows has been released (Jim did the X-Windows version,
      someone else did the Mac version). WinJDIC is a version for MS-Windows.
      The program is Copyrighted, but freeware. This means you can use it for
      and pay no fee after you download it, or pay to have some ship it to you.
      Distributors, may charge up to $10 (including postage and handling) to
      distribute it. If you do decide to distribute, it might be a good idea
      to contact us, to get the latest version. At any rate, everyone is 
      encouraged to pass it on to a friend so they may benefit from an easier
      road to learning Japanese.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.2.8 WIN/V 1.0 from C. F. C. Computing
      WIN/V is a program which allows you to have Japanese MS-Windows 
      environment on regular English Windows environments. WIN/V was made by 
      Mr. Nishimura who is a legend among Japanese Windows users.
      Since Japanese Windows application requires Kanji handling, you could 
      not run those programs on regular English MS-Windows environment. But,  
      with WIN/V, you can not only run Japanese Windows application, but 
      also you no longer needed  MS-DOS/V or PC-DOS/V. You simply install 
      WIN/V and restart Windows,  then you can have true Japanese Windows 
      environment. 
      Moreover, WIN/V supports Kanji True Type Font and can be run on 
      variety of MS-Windows environments such as Windows for Workgroup 
      3.1/3.11, OmniBook/Windows 3.1 (ROM version),  English OS/2 2.1, 
      English OS/2 2.1 for Windows, NEXTSTEP 3.2/Soft PC + Windows, SCO 
      Unix/Windows session, iRMX for Windows, and C. F. C. Computing
      is working on CHICAGO/V now. Unfortunately, WIN/V does not work with 
      WABI from Sun.
      Since WIN/V does not include neither KanaKanji Henkan program 
      (IME program) nor any Kanji True Type Font, you have to install those 
      programs from "Japanese MS-Windows3.1 Setup Disk."  But, most of 
      Japanese word Processors, such as MS-WORD, ICHITARO for Windows, or 
      AMI Pro for Windows, also provides both IME program and Kanji True Type
      fonts. So, for non-Japanese Windows user, you should buy at least
      one Japanese Windows word processor..   
      Where can you get it ? WIN/V can be purchased from SOFTEX (on-line
      software shop. "go swinva") in NIFTY-Serve.  Also, shareware version 
      should be available shortly on CIS. (but, IME support will be protected
      (disabled) for non-registered user.  TrueType module for shareware 
      version will be available from SOFTEX.)
      WIN/V also include "OMAKE program" which makes English Windows 
      applications Kanji-aware, but, it is a non-supported program.

3.1 Electronic Dictionaries
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1.1 The Canon WordTank
  This file was supposed to be the separated WordTank FAQ, but it makes more
  sense to put on the FAQ for sci.lang.japan. If you feel the need, it can be
  separated for distribution as long as you mention where it was originally.
  The information presented here came mainly from a file that Larry Staples
  sent me and for my own experience using a ID-7100 and ID-9500.
  1-What is it ?
    It is a small (205x92x23mm, closed, model ID8500 - the biggest) battery-
    operated device that can be used as a Japanese-English (J-E), English-
    Japanese (E-J) and Kanji Dictionary (KD). The input is made in a small
    almost QWERTY keyboard and the output is on a LCD display, 52x160
    matrix.
    There is also a calculator and a calendar, and a "memorize" function that
    can make some very basic quizzes, with space for 300 words. It seems that
    the model ID8500 have some more options, but I dont know.
    There are six models:
      ID7000 - With 200.000 words, for 25.000 yens, catalog price
      ID7100 - Similar to ID7000, even the price. It seems that the only
               difference is the "jumping search".
      ID7200 - Another step-up, with 240.000 words and you can select menus
               in English or Japanese. 26.000 yens
      ID8500 - A real advance, 350.000 words, including personal and place
               names, and other features I didn't checked out. 44.000 yens.
    These were the "old" wordtanks. The "Super" wordtanks are three, the
    ID6500, ID7500 and ID9500. They have no calendar, but improved word 
    memory, slightly bigger keyboard, and the case is no long the plastic 
    one, but a tough, rubber case. The old menu key is still there but the 
    dictionary functions are no longer on the menu.  The Japanese, Kanji,
    and English functions each have their own buttons below the screen 
    along with word memo, calculator, and expansion card buttons.  The 
    "modori" button, the star button and a new history function button also
    appear below the screen.  On the right side of the screen are four
    function key-like buttons that take on different functions depending
    on the screen.  A common use for the keys would be the "jukugo," 
    or compound, function; definition; usage example; etc.  Littler 
    "icons" appear on the screen next to the buttons to suggest their
    usage. The WordTank Super has two expansion slots (not compatible
    with the ID series cards) that lock into place, and it runs on
    two AAA batteries.  Canon says the machine will run for about 250 hours on 
    two alkaline batteries. The case is only a few millimeters larger and a 
    few grams heavier than the old ID series machines (except the 8500 that
    was far bigger).
      ID6500 - This one is a new release, it seems to be the less powerful
               of them - have the navigation (jump) functions, but I believe
               that the word database is somehow smaller. I saw it by 
               15.000 yens, maybe even cheaper in other places.
      ID7500 - The new "Super" Wordtank, with a redesigned case, and the
               vocabulary of the ID7200. I believe that it haves the same
               capabilities as the ID9500, like jumping and wildcards.
      ID9500 - The top of the line, another "Super" Wordtank. The features 
               are the same as the ID7500 plus more memory. It contains 
               61,248 Japanese entries with 89,717 English definitions, 
               17,850 related Japanese words, 57,081 definitions in Japanese, 
               and 53,490 usage examples in Japanese. It contains 6,353 Kanji
               (JIS Levels 1 & 2 minus the last two kanji) with 35,875 
               compounds and 19,719 readings. Finally, it contains 60,424
               English words with thousands of definitions and related 
               English words. This all adds up to 649,170 entries. Just for
               reference, the IDX-7500 has 275,698 entries and the old 
               ID-7100 had 199,406 entries. NOTE: the names and places 
               database of the ID8500 was not added to the 7500 and 9500
               models.
    For the price, almost all the shops I saw had at least 10% off, and you
    can get them even cheaper (older models) in bargain sales.
    There is an optional printer IP-01 for 25.000 yens, I only saw it once
    in a catalog.
    There are some optional cards, like word upgrades, phrase cards
    (for business, travel, etc.) and even fortune telling, but I never had 
    the chance to test them. All these cards are on the 7000-10000 yens range.
  2-What can I do with it ?
    For the J-E function, you can enter words in Kana or Romaji, and search
    for them. The output is in kanji with furigana, and one of the very good
    points on it is that the furigana is displayed aligned with the kanji,
    so the word GAKUSEI will display small hiragana GAKU on the top of the
    kanji for GAKU and SEI on the top of the kanji for SEI. I believe that it
    is valuable so you can associate kanji with reading. Of course, japanese
    words in hiragana and katakana haves no furigana. The displayed kanji
    is big and easy to read. The meaning in english are also displayed, and
    you can use this meaning to search in the E-J for other meanings in 
    Japanese.
    For the KD function, you can search kanjis for the reading (ON- and KUN-),
    for the stroke numbers and for the radicals. When you find the desired
    kanji, the WordTank display the readings, the number of strokes, JIS
    and KUTEN code, and bushu, and allows you to seek words in the J-E that
    starts with that kanji. The "old" wordtanks will only display the
    compounds of two kanjis that starts with the kanji you selected, but
    the Super ones will search for *any* sequence that starts with the
    kanji, including words with okurigana.
    For the E-J function, you enter the word in romaji and it displays the
    meanings (usually more than one). The phonetics (sp?) of the word are
    also displayed. If the word have a link with others, you can "navigate"
    through them. 
    The model ID8500 also have a database for people's and place's names, 
    that the older models lacked.
    Some features of the Super wordtanks are:
    Jump Search - As I said above, the English and Japanese definitions and
      explanations included in the Japanese dictionary of the IDX-9500 have
      been greatly expanded.  Most words have Japanese definitions. This
      makes the improvements in "Jump Search" especially useful. Any whole 
      word displayed on any screen can be highlighted and looked up. So, for
      example, if you were to look at the Japanese definition of a word 
      (Japanese or English) and found yet another word you didn't know,  
      you could highlight that word and look it up too. You can also look 
      up any displayed English word.
    Kanji Jukugo - Another big improvement has been made in the Kanji 
      dictionary. After looking up a kanji, pressing the "jukugo" function 
      key now produces a complete list of all words starting with that 
      character, not just two kanji words as in the ID series.  Verbs,
      single kanji, two, three, and more kanji words are all listed on the 
      screen.
    Wild Cards - Both Japanese (kana, not kanji) and English words can be
      searched for using wild card characters, "*" for multiple characters 
      and "?" for single characters.  For example, it is possible to search 
      for "ga*ji," resulting in three words, while "ga?ji" would result in
      one. Searching for English words works the same way.
    History - The machine keeps a running list of the last 16 words you have
      looked up. So, if you're like me, and keep looking up the same word 
      time after time; this feature will be handy.
  3-So, which are the problems ?
    First of all, it can be called a "feature", but it is ROM-based, meaning
    that you cannot change/include/alter/annotate any entry on it. This
    characteristic also means that you should expect some new releases from
    times to times (inclusion of new words, corrections, etc.), but 
    surprisingly it does not happens. As long as I know, the Old wordtanks 
    had more than 2 years before the new releases, and in Japan, almost all
    electronic tools (cameras, videos, TVs, etc) have new models every 6 
    months. Of course, being ROM based makes it fast and small, but 
    reliable ? For the old versions, some of the entries from the J-E are 
    insufficient, and some are simply wrong. There are even some entries 
    in the J-E that  have no translation (I mean, display nothing), even on
    the ID8500 (same for the ID9500, but for the really obscures and/or
    without translation). Try ON'YOMI, for example. For the new models, 
    some words still lack translations but some have definitions... in 
    Japanese. For the KD dictionary, it will search words that start with 
    the kanji you are displaying, but only two-kanji words. For example, 
    you can find the kanji KA for KANOUSEI in the KD, and search for words 
    that start with it, and it will display KANOU but not KANOUSEI. The 
    Super models corrected this annoying problem. 
    The E-J have more meanings per word, but they are displayed in a smaller
    type (dot matrix) than the J-E, and the kanjis don't have furiganas, so
    if you don't read japanese, there is a trouble. More, you cannot 
    underline a word in Japanese and search the meaning as you can do with
    the J-E with the old models, but can with the Super ones.
    For the person's and place's names in the ID8500 model, I have a main
    complain - its usage is, enter a japanese name in kana and see the kanji.
    I guess that the inverse (enter the kanjis as in the KD and see the 
    reading) is far more useful, at least for non-Japanese speakers. 
    Some people also complained about parts that break, but seemed that the
    service (fixing, etc.) was OK - In Japan, I must add. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1.2 Jim Breen's JDIC in a Palmtop
    Here is the file I got from Jim Breen about the use of JDIC in a palmtop.
    I added some comments in ()s.
    AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE WORDTANK 
    For  the  last  couple  of  months I have been using what I believe is a 
    viable alternative to the  Canon  Wordtank  as  a  hand-held  electronic 
    dictionary.  I  have  decided to put together a detailed posting on this 
    alternative. 
    The system I have been using is the HP 100LX Palmtop PC, a hand-held and 
    fully functional PC measuring about 16x8cm.  Onto this I have loaded  my 
    JDIC  &  JREADER  programs and the EDICT,  etc.  dictionary files.  JDIC 
    performs well on this system,  to the extent that  I  now  only  use  my 
    trusty old WT (8500 plus upgrade card) on the rare occasions when a word 
    I want is not in EDICT. (It usually isn't in the Wordtank either). 
    A  few  words  about  the  Palmtop.  It  comes with many Mb of preloaded 
    software: Lotus123, database, editor, HP Calculator.  CCMail, Phonebook, 
    Appointment manager, XTREE-like Filer, Stopwatch, etc.  All this is in a 
    "D:"  drive  in ROM.  The basic systems have 1M of CMOS of which 640K is 
    DOS's memory and the rest a RAMdrive (C:).  In an  expansion  slot  (A:) 
    goes  a  8x5x0.5cm "Flashdisk";  I have a 10M version,  which comes with 
    Stacker installed,  so there is plenty of capacity  for  JDIC  etc.  The 
    processor  is  an 80186,  which seems to perform at about the speed of a 
    12Mhz 8088.  There is an Application Manager which looks after  programs 
    through  Icons and pop-down menus,  or you can run programs from the DOS 
    prompt.  Curiously,  powering the system off only turns off the display, 
    the applications stay there. I have only rebooted twice. 
    The  Palmtop has a CGA display.  Unlike earlier models,  the 100LX has a 
    full 80x25 line screen,  i.e.  640x200 pixels in high-res  CGA.  I  have 
    always found the aspect ratio of high-res CGA pretty poor for display of 
    the 16x16 kana/kanji, but the crisp LCD of the Palmtop combined with the 
    rather  flat  aspect  ratio  make  the  display  every  bit as good as a 
    monochrome VGA. 
    The Palmtop  has  a  serial  port  and  built-in  Kermit,  Xmodem,  etc. 
    protocols.  An  optional  Connectivity  Pack  enables files to be copied 
    back and forth between a PC and a Palmtop,  and for them to access  each 
    others files.  It also contains PC versions of many of the applications. 
    Of course,  the keyboard (full QWERTY) is tiny, and you can forget about 
    two-handed touch typing.  I have developed a one-handed  "hunt-and-pick" 
    which works well, particularly as it has a "sticky" Shift key. 
    With  the  Palmtop  and CGA in mind,  I have made some format changes in 
    version 2.4 of JDIC and JREADER (now in beta-test),  mainly to  get  the 
    maximum  information  into  the  reduced screen size.  Also I added some 
    features which I understand have also appeared  in  the  latest  (8xxx?)
    (my note: now 9500) 
    version of the Wordtank.  Among them are: saving & retrieval of the last 
    10 search keys, a "jump search" where the key comes from a display line, 
    and  the  ability  to log entries to a file for later review.  The kanji 
    selection via bushu also now has an option to specify the stroke count. 
    So how do they compare?  Well I have not seen the latest Wordtank, which 
    I hear is quite improved,  so this comparison is largely limited to  the 
    earlier models.
    SIZE:  almost the same.  The Palmtop is a bit thicker (about 2.5cm), and 
    heavier,  and has the typical tough HP case.  It runs on a  pair  of  AA 
    batteries, & has an external 110/230V adaptor which can charge NiCads in 
    situ.  The  Palmtop  screen  is  more than twice as large,  and with the 
    smaller size of displayed characters packs a lot more information. 
    (my note: the latest models are smaller than the old 8500)
    PRICE:  not surprisingly the Palmtop is quite a bit  more  expensive.  I 
    don't know the US price,  but extrapolating the Australian,  I expect it 
    is about $US850,  plus a couple of hundred more for the Flashdisk.  Bear 
    in  mind,  though,  that  for  this  you  get  a  LOT more than a just a 
    Wordtank,  you are getting a PC with a  lot  of  built-in  applications,  
    including a copy of Lotus123.  JDIC, EDICT, etc. are, of course, free. 
    DICTIONARY:  EDICT  & KANJIDIC total about 3.5M,  which is somewhat less 
    than the  Wordtank's  claimed  dictionary.  However  the  7200/8500  had 
    separate  E->J  and  J->E  dictionaries,  which  was wasteful.  JDIC can 
    access the full JIS 1 & 2  sets,  whereas  many  are  missing  from  the 
    Wordtank.  From my observation,  there is not much in the Wordtank which 
    is not now in EDICT,  and EDICT's English  translations  are  much  more 
    complete.  Both can access kanji via reading, bush and/or stroke counts.  
    JDIC  also  accesses  by  JIS  code,  KUTEN,  Nelson  and  Halpern  nos. 
    KANJIDIC's collection of readings seems  much  more  comprehensive  than 
    those  in the Wordtank.  Also,  JDIC,  EDICT,  etc.  are being regularly 
    upgraded, and thus the Palmtop option can improve for no extra outlay. 
    SPEED:  the Wordtank is much faster.  The typical  word  search  on  the 
    Palmtop takes an average of 4 seconds (cf 2.2 on my 16Mhz 386). This may 
    reduce  if  Stacker  were disabled.  Kanji searches take about a second, 
    but  a  full  screen  takes  about  3  seconds   to   paint.   This   is 
    understandable,  given the general nature of the Palmtop vs the ASICs in 
    the Wordtank. 
    OTHER APPLICATIONS:  The address book,  phone-list and calculator in the 
    Palmtop  are  infinitely  superior to those on the Wordtank.
    (my note: the oldest wordtanks had only Calendar/calculator, the new
    ones only the calculator. Did the 8500 had phone list and address book ?)
    Really the 
    applications do not compare,  as the Palmtop is packed with  goodies.  I 
    find the Appointment system very impressive,  particularly in the way it 
    can migrate the details back and forth between the Palmtop and a  PC.  I 
    often carry my Palmtop in my coat packet, and find it very convenient to 
    use  the  built-in editor (Memo) for jotting down notes,  drafting text, 
    etc.  I have also loaded the JREADER program on board,  and to prove  it 
    was  possible,  downloaded  a copy of the Genji Monogatari.  A bit meaty 
    reading for train journeys,  but feasible.  I also installed a  copy  of 
    MOKE,  which  is  the  only  wa-puro I know of for vanilla PCs which can 
    function on a CGA.  MOKE works fine.  It gave me quite a buzz  to  enter 
    kanji  and  kana  text  on such a tiny system,  but it does it well.  (I 
    believe there is a localized version of the HP Memo program available in 
    Japan, but I have no details of it.) 
    I realize this  is  partly  blowing  my  own  trumpet,  but  I  strongly 
    recommend  that  people  who  are  thinking  about  buying  a  hand-held 
    electronic dictionary consider  the  Palmtop  as  an  alternative.  With 
    JDIC,  etc  installed  it  performs,  I  think,  every  bit as well as a 
    Wordtank,  and in some aspects a lot better.  Also  it  is  a  far  more 
    versatile system, with all the potential of a full PC, as well as having 
    many  good application packages.  I think HP have done an amazing job of 
    packing so much into such a small container.  After all, can you imagine 
    a  Wordtank  that is also  Japanese word-processor, runs Lotus and has a
    full-function HP Business Calculator. 
    [Since writing the above, I have received copies of some futher Japanese
    software for the HP100LX. This includes as TSR FEP and a JIS text display
    program. I have not found time to try them out, as the installation is a
    little tricky, and anyway the software I have is working well.]

3.1.3 Sony DATA-Discman
    It is a device to read special 3.5" CD-ROMs in a format called EB 
    (Electronic Book, ou Denshi-Book). These CD-ROMs can be removed from the
    cartridges and put on an adaptor to be read by CD-ROM drivers for PC
    compatibles. There are two programs for Windows and one add-on for Mule
    (Unix) to work as front-ends for these EBs. There are several dictionaries
    published as EBs, including the Kenkyusha's.

    (Rafael's note: I am not sure if their interface are easy to use for
    foreigners - need to look at one first ;-)
===============================================================================
3.2 Electronic Organizers (Denshi Tetyou)
    This is a category apart. There are some that have built-in eiwa-waei
    dictionaries, but they are too small compared with WordTank and similars.
    Some have expansion cards with dictionaries.

4. General Information on Japanese Language
===============================================================================
4.1 Writting Systems
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.1.1 General Information
   Traditionally,  Japanese is  written  from top to bottom and right  to left.
Pages are bound at the right hand side, making books and magazines appear as if
they are printed backwards to Westerners. Nowadays the younger generation tends
to write the Western way (unless for official purposes), that is left to right,
top to bottom. This way  is also  used in scientific books where text  is  used
along  with  mathematical formulas which  are necessarily (really?) horizontal.
Literature is printed the traditional way.
   Written Japanese employs four character sets: romaji, hiragana, katakana and
kanji. Spacing between  words with  the  latter three is up  to the  writer. In
books for  beginning readers spaces between words may  be abundant, but in more
advanced texts they may be few. The equivalent of a period is  called "maru", a
small circle.  A comma  is represented by a "ten",  a long dot. Its use  is not
governed by any strict rules (like in most languages). Quotations are indicated
by the  top left  and bottom  right parts of a square. Question and exclamation
marks are used once in a while. The particles ka  and ne fulfill the respective
functions, so that there is no real need for either mark.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.1.2 Hiragana and Katakana
   The   kana,  hiragana  and  katakana,  are  strictly  phonetic  syllabaries.
Hiragana, the more flowing form of the two, is  said  to have been invented  by
the Buddhist priest  Ku^kai  (774-835),  although this  is controversial.  Each
hiragana  symbol derives from a  Chinese character  of the  same sound,  but is
devoid of any  meaning. The invention of hiragana  had a significant impact  on
Heian  literature (794-1185) as it  enabled  women to  write  (education was  a
virtually  male-only  privilege). The most famous  contribution,  no doubt,  is
"Genji monogatari" [The tale of Genji] by MURASAKI Shikibu.
   Katakana, literally "side script"  and the more  angular of the two kana, is
said to  have been  invented by KIBI no Makibi (693-755). Each katakana  symbol
derives from parts  of  a Chinese  symbol in  the  same way as the hiragana do.
Katakana were initially used as a pronunciation aid in Buddhist scriptures, but
were mixed with Chinese characters from the ninth century on.
   Both syllabaries  use  two diacritical marks to modify  the pronunciation of
several  of the kana. Two  small dots at the upper right hand corner  produce a
voiced version, that is: k->g, s->z, t->d and h->b. A  small circle at the same
position  changes h to  p.  Finally, the  kana for  "ya", "yu" and  "yo" can be
combined  with  the  "-i"  kana  to  form  a  palatalized  sound, for  example:
pi+ya->pya.
   Knowing hiragana  and/or katakana one can write anything one wishes to write
in  Japanese. In  practice  however, hiragana are used  for originally Japanese
words and katakana is reserved for foreign words. Katakana can also be used for
emphasis, very  much like  italics  are  being used  for emphasis in the  roman
alphabet.  This is  relatively common in manga. Moreover, the use  of kana  is,
depending  on  the level of education, limited to (parts of) words which have a
grammatical function, such as  particles, conjuctions and inflectional endings.
The content of what one wants to express is written in kanji. One other  use of
the hiragana  is as pronunciation aid for uncommon  kanji.  Found  on the right
hand  side  or  above the  kanji, they  are referred  to as furigana ("handicap
kana") or yomigana ("reading kana").
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.1.3 Kanji
   The kanji have been borrowed and adapted from the Chinese characters between
the sixth and tenth century. During and after their introduction they underwent
many  changes, both  in  Japan and China, so that now both languages have their
own set of kanji although many  similarities exist. After the Meiji restoration
(1868) the government has tried  to simplify and standardize the Japanese kanji
(I"m  not  sure  about this!).  In  1946  the  last big government interference
resulted in the To^yo^ kanji. This set contains 1850 kanji,  881  of which made
up the  Kyo^iku kanji. The Jinmei-yo^ kanji contained an additional 85 kanji in
use for family and geographical names. The Jinmei-yo^ set can be seen  as a set
of standard non-standard kanji.  The Kyo^iku set was to be  mastered by the end
of elementary school  and the To^yo^  set  by the end of high school. Nowadays,
the Jinmei-yo^ set contains 284 kanji, the Gakushu^ set, formerly Kyo^iku, 1006
and the Jo^yo^, formerly To^yo^, 1945. The Gakushu^ kanji are still a subset of
the  Jo^yo^ kanji and  taught in elementary school. The Jo^yo^ kanji are taught
in high school.
   It is  not necessary to know all Jo^yo^  and Jinmei-yo^  kanji to be able to
read most  Japanese.  Several studies indicate that  knowing  about  1000,  for
example the Gakushu^, enables one to read some 90%. Knowing  the  Jo^yo^ allows
you to read about 99%  of written Japanese. However, not  knowing a kanji  does
not necessarily mean that one can  not guess  its  meaning.  Many of  the  more
complicated kanji are combinations of simpler kanji (see below).
   The kanji  are ideographs representing objects and/or ideas. For each  kanji
three things  must be learned:  its root meaning, its writing (stroke order and
stroke   endings)  and,  the  most  difficult,   its  reading  (pronunciation).
Generally, every kanji has two types of reading. On-yomi or Chinese  reading is
based on the Japanese imitation of  the ancient Chinese  pronunciation  of  the
character. Kun-yomi or Japanese reading  represents the original  Japanese word
corresponding to the ancient  Chinese meaning of  the  kanji. Put  differently,
on-yomi  is a mapping of Japanese sounds on the spoken form  of written Chinese
whereas kun-yomi is a mapping of spoken Japanese on written Chinese.
   There are no strict rules  to decide whether a kanji is read on-yomi or kun-
yomi, but as a rule of  thumb: a kanji occuring in  a compound with other kanji
is  read on-yomi, a kanji all by itself is read kun-yomi. Note that a kanji may
have  more than one on-yomi and/or  more than one kun-yomi.  Fortunately, there
are some kanji that have either only one on-yomi or only one kun-yomi.
   An example should make all this a bit clearer.  Take the  kanji for moon. By
itself,  just  plain moon,  it is read  "tsuki" (kun-yomi).  This  is the  only
kun-yomi it has. Well, let's be fair, it can also  be read "zuki", for  example
in "mikazuki", "three day moon" (->new moon), but  this is merely  a change for
ease of pronunciation (?). By the way, "mikazuki"  is a severe exception of the
rule of thumb:  all  three  kanji are read  kun-yomi fashion.  In "first  moon"
(->first month-> January)  it combines  with the kanji for  one, "ichi", and is
read "gatsu".  Thus, "ichigatsu"  means  January. In "moon  day"  (->Monday) it
combines with the  kanji  for  day,  "yo^  bi",  and  is  read "getsu".   Thus,
"getsuyo^bi" is Monday. So, "moon" has two (accidently similar) on-yomi.
   In many cases the more complicated kanji, in terms of stroke count, are made
up of simpler kanji. Their meaning  can usually be inferred from the meaning of
the simpler kanji. The simple kanji used  in  those  more complicated  ones are
referred to  as graphemes or radicals.  Due to  size restrictions,  every kanji
takes  up  the same  amount  of space, these graphemes  or radicals  can become
somewhat distorted with respect to the  original. In two-grapheme kanji such as
"bright",  where "sun" and "moon" are placed alongside (and squeezed), the left
hand side is called "hen" and the right hand side "tsukuri".
   Shodo^  or calligraphy is practiced by  many Japanese.  Basically, there are
three  styles to  write  the  kanji: kaisho  (print  or  block  style), gyo^sho
(cursive style) and so^sho  ("grasshand" style). Kaisho resembles the  style of
kanji  in  mechanically   produced  texts.  Although   primarily  referring  to
calligraphy, kaisho is also used to indicate the style  of these  texts. Formal
correspondence  is  usually written  in kaisho,  whereas  gyo^sho  is  used  in
personal  correspondence.  Artistic writings on screens  and  monuments  and in
paintings often  use so^sho.  Easily recognized  by its reminiscence to flowing
reeds, it is the hardest to read of the three.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.1.4 Romanization (Romaji)
   Romaji is basically a  method of writing the Japanese language in the  roman
alphabet (the very same as the one you"re reading now). Originally developed by
Jesuit missionaries in the sixteenth century, there now are  various methods of
romanization. The most common one is the (modified) Hepburn system (hebon-shiki
or hyo^jun-shiki).  It was established by James C. Hepburn (1815-1911) who also
founded  Meiji Gakuin University.  Its popularity stems from the better  compa-
tibility  with the  Japanese sounds than kunrei-shiki  (the official,  but vir-
tually obsolete, system) and Nihon-shiki.  Nihon-shiki  is  governed  by simple
rules and is taught in elementary schools.
   The use of romaji, or roman  alphabet, in everyday Japanese is very limited.
Abbreviations, advertisements and street signs are among  the few instances you
will see them. One area in which romaji are in wide-spread use is in text books
for studying  Japanese for foreigners.  Most intermediate and advanced students
of the  language will agree  that the use  of romaji will  prove an obstacle in
learning how to read "real" Japanese.

4.2 Pronunciation
     The following is a description of the sound system of Japanese. The
     first three sections are a brief linguistic summary. Section 4.2.4
     focuses on practical pronunciation problems faced by foreigners, 
     especially speakers of English. Check also the Quick Pronunciation
     Guide, section
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.2.1  The Sounds of Japanese
     The following are the meaningful sound elements (phonemes) of 
     Japanese.
          Vowels
            /a/  /i/  /u/  /e/  /o/
          Consonants
            Stops:  /p/  /b/  /t/  /d/  /k/  /g/  /?/ (= glottal stop)
            Stops with fricative release:  /ch/  /j/
            Fricatives:  /h/  /z/  /s/  /sh/
            Liquids:  /r/  /w/
            Nasals:  /m/  /n/  /n'/            (/n'/ = syllabic nasal)
          Semivowel
            /y/
          Note to linguists: The above phonemes should be enough to 
          account for all native Japanese and assimilated Sino-Japanese 
          words. However, some recent borrowings from other languages may 
          require additional phonemes (the Japanese words for 'tsar', 
          'violin', etc.).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.2.2  Phonemic Rules
     The phonemes listed in 4.2.1 may change when they are actually 
     pronounced. The following are some of the most important phonemic 
     rules.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.2.2.1  Vowels
     /i/ and /u/ usually become voiceless in the following two contexts:
         (1) after /t/ /s/ /sh/ /ch/ /h/ at the end of a word
         (2) between /t/ /s/ /sh/ /ch/ /h/ and /p/ /t/ /k/
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.2.2.2  Consonants
     /t/ becomes /ch/ before /i/
     /t/ is pronounced [ts] before /u/

     /d/ becomes /j/ before /i/
     /d/ becomes /z/ before /u/

     /g/ is often pronounced [ng] between vowels (as in English "singer")
     /h/ is pronounced as a bilabial fricative before /u/  (see 4.2.4.4)

     /z/ becomes /j/ before /i/
     /s/ becomes /sh/ before /i/

     /n'/ becomes /m/ before /p/ /b/ /m/
     /n'/ is pronounced [ng] before /k/ /g/
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.2.3  Accent
     The accent system of Japanese is based on pitch, not stress. Each 
     syllable is pronounced with about the same force, but accented 
     syllables are pronounced at a higher pitch. See also 4.4.4.6 below.

     Some generalizations: All high-pitch syllables in a word are 
     contiguous. If the first syllable is high, then all the remaining 
     syllables are low. If the first syllable is low, then the second 
     syllable is high. One-syllable words may have either a low rising 
     pitch or a high falling pitch.

     The following examples, given in standard romanization, are taken 
     from the introduction to the dictionary Daijirin (Sanseido, 1988). 
     These are all of the single-word accent patterns up to six syllables. 
     Capital letters indicate the high pitch. The mark  ^  at the end of a 
     word indicates that the high pitch may carry over into the following 
     word (especially if the following word is a particle such as  wa  or 
     ga ).

     1 syllable:   na^  [next syllable high]    KI  [next syllable low]
     2 syllables:  miZU^   Aki   haNA
     3 syllables:  kaISHA^   DEnki   oKAshi   oTOKO
     4 syllables:  daIGAKU^   BUngaku   yuKIguni   saIJIki  oTOOTO
     5 syllables:  chuUGOKUGO^   SHAabetto   fuKYUuritsu   yaMANObori
                   koGATABAsu   moMONOHANA
     6 syllables:  keNBUTSUNIN^   KEnmohororo   oMAwarisan   kiNKOnshiki

4.2.4  Problems for Learners of Japanese (English speakers)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.2.4.1  Short and Long Sounds
     All of the vowels and most of the consonants of Japanese may be 
     pronounced either short or long. In normal speech, long sounds are 
     held for about twice the length of time as short sounds. The 
     difference between long and short sounds is very significant, and 
     Japanese have no trouble at all remembering which words have short 
     sounds and which words have long sounds. Here are some minimal pairs, 
     i.e., words distinguished only by the length of the sound:

        shujin  "husband"            shuujin  "prisoner"
        koto    "thing"              kooto    "coat"
        kata    "shoulder"           katta    "won"
        kosetsu "old explanation"    kossetsu "bone breakage"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.2.4.2  Consonant + /y/ Clusters
     When the semivowel /y/ follows a consonant, learners of Japanese 
     often insert a vowel between the consonant and /y/. However, no vowel 
     belongs there and the presence of a vowel can lead to misunderstand-
     ings. It may take some practice to learn how to say these clusters 
     smoothly.

        Correct     Incorrect
        [ryokan]    [riyokan]   "Japanese inn"
        [byooin]    [biyooin]   "hospital"  (cf. biyooin "beauty parlor")
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.2.4.3  /r/
     In many dialects of English, /r/ is pronounced before vowels with the 
     lips slightly rounded and the tongue not touching the roof of the 
     mouth, while /l/ is pronounced before vowels with no lip rounding and 
     with the tip of the tongue touching lightly against the roof of the 
     mouth. The Japanese /r/ sound varies more or less freely between 
     these two sounds, i.e., sometimes the tongue touches the roof of the 
     mouth and sometimes it doesn't. (That's why new students of Japanese 
     may hear the sound sometimes as /r/ and sometimes as /l/.) However, 
     unlike English /r/, there is no lip rounding with Japanese /r/. The 
     lips should stay relaxed. (When Japanese comedians imitate foreigners 
     speaking Japanese, they generally include a lot of heavily rounded 
     /r/ sounds and /r/-colored vowels, because those are the features 
     that sound most distinctively non-Japanese to them.)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.2.4.4  /hu/ = /fu/
     When the phoneme /h/ comes before /u/, it is pronounced as a bilabial 
     fricative. What this means is that the lips are brought close enough 
     together to create a light hissing sound. Unlike English /f/, 
     however, the lower lip does not touch the upper teeth.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.2.4.5  Vowels
     Most English vowels are diphthongs, i.e., the tongue and/or lips move 
     as the vowel is being pronounced. In American English, for example, 
     the vowel sound in the word 'cake' starts as the mid front vowel /e/ 
     and glides to near the high front vowel /i/. The vowels in the 
     word 'two' and 'boat' have more lip rounding at the end than the 
     beginning. In Japanese, however, vowel quality remains nearly 
     constant from the beginning to the end of a vowel. Heavily 
     diphthongized vowels are a clear indicator of a foreign accent in 
     Japanese.

     As described in 4.2.2.1, Japanese vowels often become voiceless in 
     certain contexts. This means that, to a foreign ear, the vowel seems 
     to be missing:
     
        doko desu ka   sounds like   doko des ka
        arimasu        sounds like   arimas
        chikaku        sounds like   chkaku
        shita          sounds like   shta

     This does not happen all the time, though. If a speaker is 
     emphasizing a particular word or speaking slowly, then these vowels 
     might remain voiced. Sentence-final vowels seem to be voiced more 
     often in women's speech than in men's.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.2.4.6  Accent
     As described in 4.2.3, Japanese accent is based on pitches, not 
     stress. An English speaker learning Japanese is apt to put too much 
     emphasis on certain syllables. To Japanese ears, this sounds bouncy 
     and sing-songy.
     Many native Japanese teachers do not emphasize accent when they teach 
     Japanese pronunciation, probably because there is a lot of regional 
     variation. In particular, many words have opposite accent patterns in 
     Kanto and Kansai. For the foreign student, however, it is better to 
     try to acquire some kind of native accent (even if it isn't standard 
     NHK style) rather than to retain a strong foreign accent.

5.2 Focus on Kanji, Reading and Writing
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.2.1 A Japanese Reader - Graded Lessons for Mastering the Written Language
      General Information: A Japanese Reader, by Roy Andrew Miller, published 
        by Tuttle Language Library. ISBN 0-8048-1647-6, 250+ pages, English
        and Japanese, first edition 1962, third printing 1991. I forgot the
        price. 
      Main Features: Present 75 graded lessons for reading japanese. Each 
        lesson haves a text in Japanese and explanations and translations 
        (reading notes) for some words in English. It is presumed that the
        reader have some background in Japanese. The first 12 lessons cover
        hiragana and katakana, lessons 13-17 some basic kanjis, lessons 18-30
        elementary reading, 31-47 intermediate, 48-59 advanced fiction and
        60-75 advanced non-fiction, making it useful for readers from the
        novice until the upper-intermediate level. It makes a lot of references
        to Samuel Martin's "Essential Japanese" and Florence Sakade et al. 
        "A Guide to Reading and Writing Japanese". It presents the words and 
        kanjis in a context in almost all of the lessons.

        Covers kana, kanji, and grammar. Designed for those who know no
        Japanese.

5.2.3 Remembering the Kanji: A complete course on how not to forget the  
	 meaning and writing of Japanese characters by James W. Heisig 
      General Information: Publisher: Japan Publications Trading Co. 1986
         (3rd) ISBN 0-87040-739-2 Price: 4000 Yen, $29.95
      Main Features: controversial method. Its' introduction makes the claim
        that about 2000 kanji can be 'learnt' in about four weeks. There has
         been considerable conflict in sci.lang.japan and soc.culture.japan
         as to whether learning one English keyword for each kanji and how
         to write it constitutes "learning" a kanji or not. Some people 
         say that you cannot claim to have 'learnt' these kanji without 
         learning significant Japanese vocabulary associated with them,
         something no-one claims can be done in four weeks. Others say that
         Heisig's course (he does not claim to have invented the method) 
         teaches the 'kanji', separate from vocabulary and pronounciation 
         with which are associated, but semantically separate parts the 
         Japanese language. These of course must be learnt if you are to learn
         "The Japanese Language", rather than just a very small part of it.

        part is the best part of the book: very handy to have around when 
        you're reading books, stories and diaries from the Heian period and 
        later.

        All explanations are in Japanese.  The recorded material is 
        interesting, funny, and original, a real pleasure to listen to and 
        work with. Very highly recommended. (review by Ken DeLong)

5.5.2.8 Japanese Character Dictionary: With Compound Lookup via Any Kanji
          by Mark Spahn and Wolfgang Hadamitzky
     General Information: published by Cheng & Tsui Company in U.S., 1991
       Nichigai Associates in Japan, 1989, ISBN 0-88727-170-7 (U.S. edition)
       1669 pages
     Main Features: As the title implies, the main feature of this book is 
       compound lookup by any Kanji.  This is great if the second or third 
       character in a compound is easier to find than the first character.  
       The book is bright yellow with three blue stipes (in U.S. edition at
       least) and cost me $39.95 at Kinokuniya New York.  Spahn and 
       Hadamitzky have also published several titles with Tuttle.  I think 
       this is a great book and finally replaced my Nelson for most uses 
       (Nelson is still more extensive)

      Review by the author (Ken Lunde) (edited)
===============================================================================
5.8 Manga (comics)
    This will be controversial... I want to list here some mangas that
    can help on Japanese study. They have several advantages over "normal"
    text: are very abundant in several difficulty levels, are very cheap
    (I believe even outside Japan) and are more interesting ;-) The 
    disadvantages are: some are garbage, and maybe difficult to get in
    some places. Anyway, they *can* be used for learning, and I am an
    amateur mangaholic, so here it goes. Before, an introduction by
    Alfredo Liu-Perez, based on the alt.arts.anime FAQ and with some
    comments (in parenthesis):
        Manga: Pronounced "man-gah". Manga are Japanese comic books and 
        have their roots in Ukiyo-e wood prints and other traditional art.
        There are no hard rules in defining manga, but here are some 
        general characteristics:
        1. Drawn in black and white (sometimes over colored paper. For
           some compilations, the first pages of the main story are in
           full-color. There is maybe an explanation for it, but I could
           not figure it out yet).
        2. Compilations of several manga may appear in thick paperback books
           of more than 700 pages! (that will be read in minutes: some
           pages are only onomatopoeia, that can describe anything you can
           imagine)
        3. They can be quite graphically violent and erotic (including some
           in compilations for young people).
        4. Most mangas are stories that continue, like soap operas, but 
           after a some years will end (and they mean *end* - not like 
           DC or Marvel comics, that can even ressurect the same 50-year
           character).
        5. They are created and drawn by the same person (always ?).
        Manga related postings can be posted in rec.arts.manga.
    I will divide tentatively the Manga section in 5 degrees of difficulty.
    I think that it is impossible to classify the compilations with several
    stories, so I will just comment on the titles that are republished as
    books. Of course, the complexity of the storyline is only sometimes 
    related with the difficulty of the language used. Some of them cannot
    be classified in a 1-5 grade, so other classification with explanation
    is provided.
    The 5 classifications are:
    Level 1: Very Easy Manga: Almost all words are in Hiragana, and even some
      Katakana words have Furigana in Hiragana. Sometimes the words are
      separated to make an easier reading. Usually no Kanjis.
    Level 2: Easy Manga: Almost all Kanjis have furigana, except the very 
      obvious ones. Usually no furigana for katakana.
    Level 3: This is the average manga for the average reader (foreigner, 
      of course :-) requires a fair knowledge of kanjis and vocabulary.
    Level 4: Harder to read, almost no furiganas, words not so common or 
      easy to understand.
    Level 5: A real challenge. No furiganas except on some obscure readings,
      kanjis and words sometimes technical.

6.3.1 Nihongo Nouryoku Shiken - Japanese Language Proficiency Test
      This test is administered by the Ministry of Education in Japan and
      the Foreign Ministry abroad. It is divided in 4 levels, Level 1 being 
      the highest level of difficulty, 4 the lowest. The following info was
      extracted from the manuals for the test:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.3.1.1 Objectives of the Japanese Language Proficiency Test
      The number of foreigners studying Japanese is rapidly increasing
      worldwide, and the day has come when those who have acquired the
      language can put their skills to use in a wide variety of careers.
      Students of Japanese have often urged the establisment of a system by
      which their proficiency can be certified; the Japan Foundation and
      Association of International Education, Japan have devised this test
      and administered it for nonnative speakers since 1984 both in Japan and
      abroad to meet that need. Outside Japan, the Japan Foundation
      co-sponsors the administration  of the test jointly with local cultural
      exchange or educational institutions, or with administrative commitees
      established for this purpose. It is hoped that the Japanese-Language
      Proficiency Test will prove useful for the further enhancement of
      mutual understanding among nations.

8. Disclaimers
 - Standard disclaimers apply: I am NOT being paid for writing about the
   books and magazines and (as far as I know) there is no copyright 
   infringement of any kind. 
 - I am not a native English speaker, so please correct me even on this.
 - All the addresses and related information came by advertisements on the
   magazines and books, and are subject to errors. 
 - Some of the topics on this FAQ are not part of sci.lang.japan scope, but 
   some people asked me about it (specially part 7), and I decided to 
   include so I dont have to write two faqs. 
 - About some reprinted parts or whole articles of Mangajin: In 1992 I send
   a letter to them, that was published in the number 21, page 4, as follows:
   "... Is it possible to mention or quote Mangajin articles, for example, 
   the Computer Corner, on a public network ? I believe that it will benefit 
   a lot of people interested in learning Japanese and will introduce
   Mangajin to people who don't know about your magazine.". The answer was:
   "As long as there is no money changing hands, we have no objections at all
   to having portions of Mangajin reproduced or 'quoted'. As you point out,
   it helps spread the word. We welcome that kind of use in the classroom as
   well. One point I have to make, however, is that we can give permission
   only for the editorial content (basically, everything that's in English).
   We have only one-time serial rights to the manga material, and permission
   to copy that, even in the ways you mentioned, is not ours to give."
 - I would like the cooperation from whoever had read some books on the
   reviews, because some information came from advertisements, and the
   books can be in the wrong category.
 - There are some references to e-mail of authors of software and
   (maybe on the future) reviews. If somebody dont want to see his/her
   e-mail address here, tell me as soon as possible, so I can remove it.
