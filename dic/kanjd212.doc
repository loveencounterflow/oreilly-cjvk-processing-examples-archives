INTRODUCTION

The KANJD212 file is a comprehensive collection of information about the 
5,801 kanji in the JIS X 0212-1990 supplementary character set.

The basic philosophy and format of the KANJD212 file is the same as 
that in the  original KANJIDIC file, which covers the kanji in the
JIS X 0208-1990 set, and users are referred to the KANJIDIC.DOC file
for further information. This document only covers the unique aspects
of the KANJD212 file.

The KANJIDIC file is made available under the terms of the GNU Public 
Licence, a copy of which is appended to this document.

FORMAT

As in the the case of the KANJIDIC file, the KANJD212 contains a mixture 
of ASCII characters and kana/kanji encoded in the EUC (Extended Unix Code) 
coding. The first three bytes of each record are the kanji itself, coded
in the EUC-3 method, in which the first byte is 0x8F. This is the main 
method of encoding the JIS X 0212 characters in EUC. The remainder of the 
fields in each record are in the same coding and format as in the 
KANJIDIC file.

CONTENTS

At the time of its initial release, the KANJD212 file contains the 
following information about each kanji:

	Unicode (UCS2) coding
	Bushu
	Stroke count (total)
	Morohashi Daikanwajiten number (if available)
	Korean reading(s)
	Pinyin reading(s)
	On and Kun reading(s)

Further information is being compiled for later addition, including the 
Nelson, Halpern and O'Neill indices, where available, some further 
readings, and some English meanings.

COMMENTS

Note that the bushu in this file are the "classical" versions, not the 
revised Nelson versions used in the KANJIDIC file.

COMPILATION

The KANJD212 file has been compiled from a number of sources:

	- the Unicode (UCS-2) mappings are from the table available  on
          the Unicode Consortium's ftp site

	- the radical and stroke counts have been taken from the x0212-cn
          file, one of a set of file prepared some years ago by Eric
          Grinstead

	- the Morohashi numbers have been derived from the JIS X 0221
	  standards document, and are from the file Uni2Dict prepared by
	  Koichi Yasuoka <yasuoka@kudpc.kyoto-u.ac.jp>. The Uni2Dict file
	  covers all the Unicode 1.1 kanji.

	- the Pinyin readings are from the Uni2Pinyin file, also prepared
	  by Koichi Yasuoka. His file was compiled originally from the 
	  "TONEPY.tit" file prepared by Yongguang Zhang, and has been
	  supplemented from other sources, including the x0212-cn file.

	- the Japanese ON and KUN readings are mostly from the file
	  of Unicode pronunciations (Pronunciations.text) prepared by
	  the Taligent company. They have been supplemented by some 300
	  additional readings from the Grinstead files, and by readings
	  collected from several waei jiten, and from the "hojo_wnn.src"
	  file prepared for use with the WNN FEP system.

	- the Korean reading(s) have also been taken from the Taligent
	  file.
	  
The compilation of the KANJD212 has really be made possible by the activities
of a group of people collecting material for a Unicode dictionary, and the 
assembly of the file is largely a by-product of that activity. The group is
led by Jack Halpern, and I would like to express my appreciation to Jack
and the other members of the group, in particular Koichi Yasuoka, Ken Lunde,
Martin Du"rst, Christian Wittern and Chuck Muller.

APPENDIX A.

USING THE JIS X 0212-1990 CHARACTER SET

[Some comments by Jim Breen.]

Usage of the characters in the Supplementary Kanji set (which I will refer to 
here as JIS212 for brevity,) is not wide-spread. In fact, regular access to
these kanji is unlikely to become a feature of Japanese text processing
until the rather larger set of characters in the CJK portion of the 
ISO 10646/Unicode set is implemented widely. Why?, well they are pretty
obscure kanji, and it is very rare to find an occasion in normal Japanese
text-handling when the 6,355 characters in the JIS X 0208-1990 set will 
not suffice.

The only specific JIS212 font file I am aware of is the "jisksp16.bdf",
prepared by Koichi Yasuoka and others. My copy is Version 0.9 and is dated 
April 25, 1995 (ANZAC Day!). I have used this file to create the JIS21216.FNT
binary bitmap file for use with DOS applications.

As far as platforms supporting the JIS212 kanji, I have been able to 
ascertain as follows:

A. UNIX

(a) MULE

The MULE (Multilingual Emacs) system supports JIS212 codes. I am not an 
emacs user, so I cannot comment further.

(b) kterm

The kterm (kanji xterm) can be made to support JIS212 by applying a patch
file "kterm-6.1.0-6.1.0.wd2.patch" to the X11R6 version of kterm. I have
successfully installed this within X11R5 under both Linux and DEC Ultrix.
This kterm version supports both JIS208 and JIS212 in JIS (ISO 2022) and
EUC codings, but does not support Shift-JIS at all.

(c) WNN

I presume from the existence of the "hojo_wnn.src" file, which contains over
1,000 WNN henkan file entries of mappings into compounds of JIS212 kanji,
that there are versions of WNN which support JIS212. I have never got 
around to investigating them.

(d) jstevie

I am an old `vi' user, and desperately wanted to be able to edit files 
containing JIS212 kanji using a vi-like editor. As I use jstevie under both
Linux and Ultrix, I asked Junn Ohta, who did much of the kanjification of
stevie, for some suggestions, and following his advice, I produced a version
of jstevie which will edit EUC files containing JIS212 (and JIS208) kanji. 
Of course it will not handle Shift-JIS, and I haven't got around to doing a 
JIS version, although only a few changes are needed for this. Of course, it 
needs the special version of kterm.

I'll get around to releasing this version someday, but if anyone wants a
copy to try, please email me.

(d) xjdic

Of course, I needed to be able to use my own dictionary system with JIS212 
kanji, so I have extended the xjdic and xjdxgen software to handle files
with JIS212 kanji. This will be released as part of V2.2, but if anyone
want to try it out, email me.

I considered making xjdic handle KANJIDIC and KANJD212 as a single kanji 
dictionary file, however I have postponed that for a while. As an interim
step, the way to use KANJD212 with xjdic is to treat it as one of the 9
possible dictionary files. This allows reasonable searching capability.

B. MacIntosh

I am not aware of any software which handles JIS212 kanji on Macs. Bear
in mind that the JLK and Kanjitalk software uses Shift-JIS, which cannot
support JIS212.

C. Windows.

As for Macs. (I must suggest to Stephen Chung that he extend JWP to 
support JIS212 kanji. JWP and WinJDic are among the very few pieces of
Windows software that use EUC coding internally.)

DOS.

The Japanese version of DOS (DOS/V), and the NEC PC-9800 versions all use
Shift-JIS, and hence cannot support JIS212.

I have modified my JREADER text reader program to support files with JIS212
kanji. It can also reference kanji in the KANJD212 file. This will be part of
the V2.6 release, but if anyone wants to try it, please email me.

I intend to modify JDIC in a similar fashion, but that will be a while yet
as the changes are non-trivial.

                    675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

			    Preamble

  The license agreements of most software companies try to keep users
at the mercy of those companies.  By contrast, our General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  The
General Public License applies to the Free Software Foundation's
software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it.
You can use it for your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Specifically, the General Public License is designed to make
sure that you have the freedom to give away or sell copies of free
software, that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,
that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free
programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of a such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must tell them their rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.
 
		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any program or other work which
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be
distributed under the terms of this General Public License.  The
"Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based
on the Program" means either the Program or any work containing the
Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications.  Each
licensee is addressed as "you".

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this
General Public License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any
other recipients of the Program a copy of this General Public License
along with the Program.  You may charge a fee for the physical act of
transferring a copy.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
it, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph
1 above, provided that you also do the following:

    a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that
    you changed the files and the date of any change; and

    b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that
    in whole or in part contains the Program or any part thereof, either
    with or without modifications, to be licensed at no charge to all
    third parties under the terms of this General Public License (except
    that you may choose to grant warranty protection to some or all
    third parties, at your option).

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when
    run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use
    in the simplest and most usual way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
    that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
    warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
    conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this General
    Public License.

    d) You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a
    copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in
    exchange for a fee.

Mere aggregation of another independent work with the Program (or its
derivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring
the other work under the scope of these terms.
 
  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a portion or derivative of
it, under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
    Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,

    b) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party free (except for a nominal charge
    for the cost of distribution) a complete machine-readable copy of the
    corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of
    Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,

    c) accompany it with the information you received as to where the
    corresponding source code may be obtained.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form alone.)

Source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it.  For an executable file, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains; but, as a special
exception, it need not include source code for modules which are standard
libraries that accompany the operating system on which the executable
file runs, or for standard header files or definitions files that
accompany that operating system.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the
Program except as expressly provided under this General Public License.
Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer
the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights to use
the Program under this License.  However, parties who have received
copies, or rights to use copies, from you under this General Public
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties
remain in full compliance.

  5. By copying, distributing or modifying the Program (or any work based
on the Program) you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so,
and all its terms and conditions.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original
licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these
terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the
recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
 
  7. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of the license which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
the license, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  8. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  9. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  10. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 
	Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to humanity, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to
attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) 19yy  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 1, or (at your option)
    any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19xx name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show
c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your
program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
  program `Gnomovision' (a program to direct compilers to make passes
  at assemblers) written by James Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

That's all there is to it!
