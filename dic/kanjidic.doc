INTRODUCTION

The KANJIDIC file contains comprehensive information about Japanese kanji. It 
is  a  text file currently 6,355 lines long,  with one line for each kanji in 
the two levels of the characters specified in the JIS X 0208-1990  set.  (For 
information  about this set,  see Appendix A.)

The file contains a mixture of ASCII characters and kana/kanji encoded using
the EUC (Extended Unix Code) coding.

Attention is drawn to the KANJIDIC LICENCE  STATEMENT  AND  COPYRIGHT  NOTICE 
included below in this document.

A similar file, KANJD212, is available for the 5,801 supplementary kanji in 
the JIS X 0212-1990 set.

CONTENTS & FORMAT
 
The first part of each line is of a fixed format,  indicating which character 
the line is for, while the rest is more free-format. 

The first two bytes are the kanji itself.  There is then a space,  the 4-byte 
ASCII representation of the hexadecimal coding of the two-byte JIS  encoding, 
and another space. 

The  rest  of  the line is composed of a combination of three kinds of fields 
(which may be in any order and interspersed): 

(a) information fields,  beginning with an identifying letter and ending with 
a  space. See below for more information about these fields.

(b) readings (with '-' to indicate prefixes/suffixes,  and '.' to separate  a 
reading  from  its  okurigana).  ON-yomi  are in katakana and KUN-yomi are in 
hiragana.  Where the kanji has special "nanori" (i.e.  name) readings,  these 
follow the regular readings, and are separated from them by the letter "T". 

(c) English meanings.  Each such field begins with an open brace '{' and ends 
at the next close brace '}'. 

INFORMATION FIELDS
  
There are currently a variety of predefined fields (programs  using  KANJIDIC 
should not make any assumptions about the presence or absence of any of these 
fields, as KANJIDIC is certain to be extended in the future): 
        
        B<num> -- the radical (Bushu) number.  There is  one  per  entry.  As 
        far  as  possible,  this is the radical number used in Nelson.  Where 
        the classical or historical radical number differs from this,  it  is 
        present as a separate C<num> entry. 

        C<num>  --  the  historical  or  classical radical number (where this 
        differs from the B<num> entry.) There will be at most one of these. 

        F<num> -- the frequency-of-use ranking.  At most one  per  line.  The 
        2,135 most-used characters have a ranking; those characters that lack 
        this field are not ranked.  The frequency is a number from 1 to 2,135 
        that expresses the relative frequency of occurrence of a character in 
        modern  Japanese.  The  data  is based on statistics published by The 
        National Language Research Institute (Tokyo), interpreted and adapted 
        by Jack Halpern in a manner to make it useful  to  the  learner.  The 
        data  is  derived  from the New Japanese-English Character Dictionary 
        (Kenkyusha,   Tokyo  1990;   NTC,   Chicago  1993).   The  commercial 
        utilization  of  the  frequency numbers is prohibited without written 
        permission from Jack Halpern.  Use by individuals  and  small  groups 
        for  reference and research purposes is permitted,  on condition that 
        acknowledgement of the source and this notice are included.

        G<num> -- the Jouyou grade level.  At most one per line.  G1  through 
        G6  indicate Jouyou grades 1-6.  G8 indicates general-use characters.  
        G9 indicates Jinmeiyou  ("for  use  in  names")  characters.  If  not 
        present, it is a kanji outside these categories. 

        H<num>  --  the  index  number  in the New Japanese-English Character 
        Dictionary,  edited by Jack Halpern.  At most one allowed  per  line.  
        If not preset, the character is not in Halpern. 

        N<num>  --  the  index number in the Modern Reader's Japanese-English 
        Character Dictionary,  edited by Andrew Nelson.  At most one  allowed 
        per  line.  If  not  present,  the character is not in Nelson,  or is 
        considered to be a non-standard version,  in which case it may have a 
        cross-reference  code  in  the  form:  XNnnnn.  (Note that many kanji 
        currently used are what Nelson described as "non-standard"  forms  or 
        glyphs.) 

        P<code>  --  the  SKIP  pattern  code.  The  <code>  is  of  the form 
        "P<num>-<num>-<num>".  The  System  of  Kanji  Indexing  by  Patterns 
        (SKIP)  is  a  scheme  for  the classification and rapid retrieval of 
        Chinese characters on the basis of  geometrical  patterns.  Developed 
        by  Jack  Halpern,  it  first  appeared  in  the New Japanese-English 
        Character Dictionary (Kenkyusha, Tokyo 1990;  NTC, Chicago 1993), and 
        is  being  used in a series of dictionaries and learning tools called 
        KIT  (Kanji  Integrated  Tools).  SKIP  is  protected  by  copyright, 
        copyleft  and patent laws.  The commercial utilization of SKIP in any 
        form is strictly forbidden without the  written  permission  of  Jack 
        Halpern,  the  copyright  holder  (jhalpern@cc.win.or.jp).  (A  brief 
        summary of the method is in Appendix C. See Appendix E. for some of
        the rules applied when counting strokes in some of the radicals.)


        S<num> -- the stroke count.  At least one  per  line.  If  more  than 
        one,  the  first  is considered the accepted count,  while subsequent 
        ones are common miscounts. (See Appendix E. For some of the rules
        applied when counting strokes in some of the radicals.)

        U<hexnum>  --  the Unicode encoding of the kanji.  See Appendix B for 
        further information on this code. There is exactly one per line. 

        I<code> -- the index code  in  the  Spahn  &  Hadamitzky  dictionary.  
        These  are  in the form nxnn.n,  e.g.  3k11.2, where the kanji has 3
        strokes in the identifying radical, it is radical "k" in the S&H
        classification system, there are 11 other strokes, and it is the 2nd
        kanji in the 3k11 sequence. I am very grateful to Mark Spahn for 
        providing the (almost) full list of these descriptor codes for the 
        kanji in this file. At the time of writing some 800 kanji in the
        file lack the SH descriptor. This is because the book used a 
        different glyph as the primary kanji. The gaps are gradually being
        filled in. Where the JIS X 0208 glyph does not conform with the 
        descriptor code, a new descriptor code has been invented with a
        trailing "X" and a cross-reference included to the descriptor in the
        text, e.g. °¢ (JIS 3022) is coded: I3d7.19X XI3d8.3

        Qnnnn.n -- the "Four Corner" code for that  kanji.  This  is  a  code 
        invented by Wang Chen in 1928, it has since then been widely used for 
        dictionaries in China and Japan. In some cases there are two of these 
        codes, as it is can be little ambiguous, and Morohashi has some kanji 
        coded differently from their traditional Chinese codes.  See Appendix 
        D  for  an overview of the Four Corner System.  Note that these codes 
        are in need of proof-reading (planned for 1994) and  thus  users  are 
        advised to be cautious using the codes for serious scholarship. 

        MNnnnnnnn  and  MPnn.nnnn  --  the  index  number   and   volume.page 
        respectively of the kanji in  the 13-volume Morohashi "DaiKanWaJiten. 
        In the MNnnn field, a terminal `P`, e.g. MN4879P, indicates  that it 
        is 4879' in the original. In some 500 cases, the number is terminated 
        with an `X`, to indicate that the kanji in Morohashi has a close, but 
        not identical, glyph to the form in the JIS X 0208 standard.

        Ennnn  --  the  index number used in "A Guide To Remembering Japanese 
        Characters" by Kenneth G.  Henshall.  There are 1945 kanji with these 
        numbers (i.e. the Jouyou subset.) 
        
        Knnnn -- the index number in the  Gakken  Kanji  Dictionary  ("A  New 
        Dictionary  of Kanji Usage").  Some of the numbers relate to the list 
        at  the  back  of  the  book,  jouyou  kanji  not  contained  in  the 
        dictionary, and various historical tables at the end. 

        Lnnnn -- the index number used in "Remembering The  Kanji"  by  James 
        Heisig. 

	Onnnn -- the index number in "Japanese Names", by P.G. O'Neill.
        (Weatherhill, 1972)

        Wxxxx -- the romanized form of the Korean reading(s) of the kanji.
        Most of these kanji have one Korean reading, a few have two or more.
        The readings are in the (Republic of Korea) Ministry of Education
        style of romanization.

        Yxxxxx -- the "PinYin" of each kanji, i.e.  the (Mandarin or Beijing) 
        Chinese romanization.  About 6,000 of the kanji have these. Obviously 
        most of the native Japanese kokuji do not have PinYin, however one
        does as it was taken into Chinese at a later date. 
        
        Xxxxxxx -- a cross-reference code. An entry of, say, XN1234 will mean 
        that the user is referred to the kanji with the (unique) Nelson index 
        of  1234.  XJxxxx  is  a  cross-reference  to  the kanji with the JIS 
        hexadecimal code of xxxx. 

        Zxxxxxx -- a mis-classification code.  It means that  this  kanji  is 
        sometimes mis-classified as having the xxxxxx coding.  In the case of 
        the SKIP classifications,  an extra letter code is used  to  indicate 
        the  type  of  mis-classification.  ZPPn-n-n,  ZSPn-n-n  and ZBPn-n-n 
        indicate mis-classification according to position,  stroke-count  and 
        both position and stroke-count. (ZRPn-n-n codes are where Jim Breen &
        Jack Halpern are having a [hopefully temporary] disagreement over the
        number of strokes.)

If the final field of a line is not an English field, there is a final space. 
Each reading and information field is therefore bracketed by space characters 
(which makes it convenient for searches using programs like "grep".) 

As  far  as  possible  all  entries  will  have  their  yomikata and readings 
attached, even if they are a recognized variant of another kanji.  This is to 
facilitate electronic searches using these fields as keys,  and should not be 
taken as a recommendation to use such obscure kanji. 

CURRENT USAGE 

KANJIDIC  is used now to build the "kinfo.dat" file which is used by JDIC and 
JREADER,  and by Stephen Chung's  JWP.  "kinfo.dat"  contains  the  identical 
information,  but  in  a compressed form and in a structure suitable for fast 
indexed access. 

KANJIDIC  is  also  used in the XJDIC and MacJDic dictionary programs,  and a 
growing number of other programs such as KDRILL and KDIC. 

SUPPORT

KANJIDIC was originally compiled, and is maintained by:

         Jim Breen
         (jwb@dgs.monash.edu.au)
         Department of Digital Systems
         Monash University, Victoria, Australia

If  you  have  suggested  changes,  send  diffs  [not  complete  files]  with 
corrections to him. 


TOO MUCH INFORMATION?

KANJIDIC is now rather large, and has information in it which is not much use 
for  people who are not studying and researching Japanese orthography.  It is 
still appropriate to maintain it as a useful freely-available  compendium  of 
such information. 

For people who only wish to use a subset  of  the  information  in  KANJIDIC, 
there is a program "kdfilt.c", also available as kdfilt.exe for MS-DOS, which 
will strip out unwanted fields. Dan Crevier has also released a program
(kanjidicSplit) which does the same for MacJdic users. (For users of the JDIC
program, the KANJDFIX.EXE utility also strips out unwanted fields prior to
building the KINFO.DAT file.)

HISTORY (comments by Jim Breen)

KANJIDIC began as two files:  jis1detl.lst and jis2detl.lst, which were later 
merged into a single file. 

The  first  file was compiled initially from the file "kinfo.dat" supplied by 
Stephen Chung,  who in turn compiled his file from a file  prepared  by  Mike 
Erickson.  I  originally added about 1900 "meanings" by James Heisig keyed in 
by Kevin Moore from the book "Remembering  The  Kanji".  I  later  added  the 
meanings  from  Rik Smoody's files,  compiled when he was working for Sony in 
Japan. These appear to be based on Nelson. 

The second file was compiled from a complete JIS2 list with Bushu and  stroke 
counts  kindly  supplied  to  me  by  Jon  Crossley,  to which I added Nelson 
numbers, yomikata and meanings extracted from Rik Smoody's file. 
                                                                 
Theresa Martin was an  early  assister  with  this  file,  particularly  with 
tracking  down  and  correcting many mistranscribed yomikata (the old zu/dzu, 
oo/ou, ji/dji, etc. problems). 

Jeffrey Friedl did a major overhaul in September-October 1992,  in  which  he 
added  the  frequency  rankings,  Halpern codes,  SKIP patterns,  updated the 
grading ("G" fields) to reflect the modern Jouyou  lists,  corrected  radical 
numbers,  corrected  stroke  counts  and readings to fall in line with modern 
usage. 

Magnus Halldorsson corrected some erroneous  Halpern  numbers,  and  provided 
them  for  a  lot  of  the radicals.  He provided the list of Heisig indices, 
which he originally compiled himself,  then verified and expanded using lists 
from Richard Walters and Antti Karttunen. He also passed on to me the list of 
Gakken indices compiled by Antti Karttunen. 

Lee Collins provided the Unicode mappings (see appendix B) 

Iain Sinclair has provided the yomikata,  meanings and S&H indices of many of 
the obscure JIS2 kanji. 

Christian  Wittern,  a  Sinologist  working  at Kyoto University,  sent me a 
monster file prepared by Dr Urs App from Hanazono College.  From this I  have 
extracted the Four Corner and Morohashi information.  Christian also provided 
the  PinYin details.  I am very grateful for these significant contributions.  
In March  1994  the  Morohashi  indices  were  proof-read  and  corrected  by 
Christian. 

Alfredo Pinochet supplied all the Henshall numbers. 

Ingar Holst has provided considerable assistance in regularizing the Bnnn and 
Cnnn  radical classifications to remove some errors that were in the original 
JIS2 file, and to make it all conform to Nelson's classification. 

In mid-1993 I withdrew the  SKIP  codes  from  the  distributed  file  as  it 
appeared  that  their  presence  violated  Jack  Halpern's copyright on these 
codes. Jeffrey Friedl contacted Jack about this, and Jack obtained permission 
from his publisher for the codes to be included subject to the copyright  and 
usage restrictions stated in this document. In March 1994 the Halpern indices 
and SKIP codes were checked against an extract from Jack's files, and the "Z" 
mis-classification  codes added,  again from his files.  Jack has also made a 
lot of useful comments and suggestions about the content and  format  of  the 
file.  I am most grateful to Jack for his permission and assistance, and also 
to Jeffrey for making the contact. 

In May 1995, a number of updates took place. Jeffrey Friedl established 
contact with James Heisig, and obtained a further set of his indices. I 
contacted Mark Spahn (via the "honyaku" mailing list) and he kindly provided
most of the missing S&H descriptors, and Jack Halpern released to me the SKIP
codes of the kanji not in the New Japanese-English Character Dictionary. For
all this material I am most grateful.

In August 1995, I added the O'Neill index numbers. These were compiled by 
Jenny Nazak, David Rosenfeld and myself. Thanks to Jenny & David for their 
assistance.

In January and February 1996 the Morohashi numbers were checked thoroughly
against two important sources: a file of Unicode-Morohashi data (Uni2Dict)
which was prepared by Koichi Yasuoka from the allocation in the JIS X 0221
standard, and the review draft of the proposed revision of the JIS X 0208
standard, which was prepared by the INSTAC Committee, and made available in
a text file, thus enabling comparisons. All the mismatches between the three
files were examined against the Morohashi text, and extensive corrections
made to all three files. I am grateful to Koichi Yasuoka and Masayuki
Toyoshima for their considerable assistance in this task.

In March 1996 the Korean readings were added. They were provided by Charles
Muller of Toyo Gakuen University (acmuller@gol.com), to whom I am most 
grateful.

APPENDIX A - JIS CODES
======================

For full information about JIS codes,  please  see  Ken  Lunde's  "japan.inf" 
file,  or his book "Understanding Japanese Information Processing",  O'Reilly 
1993. The following is a brief extract from the "japan.inf" file. 

"The  Japanese  character  set  as  described in the document JIS X 0208-1990 
specifies 6,879 standard characters; 6,355 kanji in 2 levels (Level 1:  2,965 
kanji arranged by pronunciation;  Level 2:  3,390 kanji arranged by radical), 
86 katakana, 83 hiragana, 10 numerals, 52 Roman characters,  147 symbols,  66 
Russian  characters,  48  Greek characters,  and 32 line elements (for making 
charts). 
     
This standard was first established in 1978,  modified for the first time  in 
1983 (character position swapping,  glyph changes, and four kanji appended to 
JIS Level 2),  and modified again in 1990 (two kanji  were  appended  to  JIS 
Level 2). This character set is widely implemented on a variety of platforms. 
Encoding methods for JIS X 0208-1990 include Shift-JIS, EUC, and JIS." 

APPENDIX B - UNICODE  
====================

The  following  information  about  Unicode  was  provided  by Lee Collins at 
Taligent. 

(The Unicode sequences are) "the  final,  official  mapping  to  JIS  of  the 
CJK-JRG's  (Chinese,   Japanese,   Korean-  Joint  Research  Group)  "Unified 
Repertoire and Ordering Version 2.0" which is the unified Han  character  set 
of  ISO  10646  and  Unicode.  All  of  the  Unicode  companies (Apple,  IBM, 
Microsoft, NeXT,  Taligent,  etc) are now using this mapping.  There has been 
some confusion because of difference in nomenclature.  Unicode people call it 
UniHan,  the  Chinese sometimes call it HCS (Han Character Set) and ISO calls 
it "Ideographic CJK Character Unified Repertoire and Ordering". ISO can't use 
the term "Han" character because Japan  was  very  sensitive  to  this  (even 
though  it  is  a  direct  translation  of  "Kanzi") and it can't be called a 
character set because only ISO WG2 is empowered with the authority to  encode 
characters. Problems of naming aside, they are all the same thing. 

The  CJK-JRG  was  formed  under  the aegis of ISO in 1990 to investigate and 
propose a unified Han character set for inclusion in ISO  10646.  It  brought 
together  various  experts  on Han characters from China,  Hong Kong,  Japan, 
Korea,  Taiwan  and  the  United  States  selected  by  the  national  bodies 
participating in ISO WG2. 

Including  the  initial  work  in the US on Unicode and in China on GB 13000, 
which were merged and became the basis for the URO,  the task spanned about 4 
years.  The work was completed in April of this year.  It contains 21,000 Han 
characters from all of the major standards used in East Asia, including JIS X 
2028-1990  and  JIS  X  0212-1990.   The  Unicode   consortium   provides   a 
cross-reference file for all of the source sets. To get a copy contact

unicode-inc@HQ.M4.Metaphor.COM

For further details about the URO/UniHan, you might want to pick up a copy of 
the  "The  Unicode  Standard  Version 1.0 Vol II".  It's published by Addison 
Wesley,  ISBN 0-201-60845-6.  It's been available in the USA for over a month 
now. For a slightly different presentation of the characters, a copy of 10646 
or  of  the "Ideographic CJK Character Unified Repertoire and Ordering Verion 
2.0" might be available through the the Australian national body to ISO WG2."

                HOW TO LOCATE AN ENTRY

A. Determine the SKIP number of your character.

STEP 1  IDENTIFY PATTERN

Determine to which of the four PATTERNS your character belongs to get the
first part of the SKIP number (the PATTERN NUMBER).

If your character belongs to pattern #1, #2 or #3 (Áê¢ª#1), carry out the
steps in the left column; if it belongs to pattern #4 (²¼¢ª#4), carry out the
steps in the right column. (REF: R4. How to Identify the Pattern)

STEP 2  
 DIVIDE CHARACTER                        OMIT 
 Divide the character into two parts at  (Since solid characters 
 the first division point. [Áê=ÌÚ+ÌÜ]    cannot be divided, go to 
 REF: R5. How to Divide the Character    STEP 3.) REF: R6. How to 
                                         Subclassify the Solid Pattern

STEP 3                                  
 COUNT STROKES OF SHADED PART            DETERMINE TOTAL STROKE-COUNT
 Count the strokes of the SHADED PART    Determine the total stroke-count of

 REF: Appendix 2. How to Count Strokes   REF: Appendix 2. How to Count Strokes

STEP 4
 COUNT STROKES OF BLANK PART             IDENTIFY SOLID SUBPATTERN
 Count the strokes of the BLANK PART     Determine to which of the four

After determining the SKIP number of your character, locate your character
entry in one of two ways: 

1. Determine the entry number in the Pattern Index beginning on p. 1952 then
locate your character entry in the main part of the dictionary.  See R3.1.2
Index Method for details.

2. Locate your character entry directly (without referring to the  Pattern
Index) from its SKIP number.  See R3.1.3 Direct Method for details.

APPENDIX D: - AN OVERVIEW OF THE FOUR CORNER CODING SYSTEM
==========================================================

The Four Corner System has been used for many years in China  and  Japan  for 
classifying  kanji.  In  China  it  is  losing popularity in favour of PinYin 
ordering.  Some Japanese dictionaries,  such as the  Morohashi  Daikanwajiten 
have a Four Corner Index. 

The following overview of the system has been condensed from the article "The 
Four Corner System:  an introduction with exercises" by  Dr  Urs  App,  which 
appeared in the Electronic Bodhidharma No 2,  February 1992, published by the 
International Research Institute for Zen Buddhism,  Hanazono  College.  (More 
examples will be added from that article in due course.) 

1. Stroke shapes are divided into ten classes:

                0       LID               Ðµ
                1       HORIZONTAL LINE   °ì
                2       VERTICAL LINE     ¡Ã
                3       DOT               Ð¦
                4       CROSS             ½½
                5       SKEWER            ¥­
                6       BOX               ¸ý
                7       ANGLE             ÒÌ
                8       HACHI             È¬
                9       CHIISAI           ¾®

2. The Four Digits are derived from the Four Corners in a Z-shaped order. 

                A    B                   7  1     7  7
                         for example:     ¸¶       ·î
                C    D                   2  9     2  2

Some examples: »Å 2421  ¹Ô 2122  Îò 7121  µû 2733  »ì 0762  Æ± 7722  ¶¶ 4292

3.  A shape is only used once.  If it fills several corners, it is counted as 
zero in subsequent corners. 

Some examples: ¸ý 6000  ¼ó 8060  Ê¬ 8022  Âç 2003  ÏÂ 2690  ÉÊ 6066  µþ 0096
                                                          
4.  When the upper or lower half of a character consists of only one  (single 
or composite) shape,  it is,  rergardless of its position,  counted as a left 
corner. The right corner is counted as zero. 

Some examples: Î© 0010  Í³ 5060  Àã 1017  Êý 0022  Äí 0024  »å 2090  ¼ê 2050

5.  When there is no additional element to the four sides of  the  characters 
¸ý,  Ìç,  ò¨ (and sometimes ¹Ô), whatever is inside these characters is taken 
for the lower two corners. 

Some examples: Ìä 7760  ¼ü 6080  Ô¢ 6015  ÌÜ 6010  ³« 7744  ÌÌ 1060  îò 2110

6.  The analysis is based on the block-style handwritten kaisho (Ü´½ñ)  shape 
of characters. 

(This needs attention, as ¸Í is 3027, not 1027.  The top stroke is treated as 
a Ð¦.) 

7. Some points to note when analysing shapes: 

o Shape 0:  

When the horizontal line below a DOT shape (number 3) is connected to another 
stroke at its right-hand end (as in Õß ¸Í,  etc.) it is not counted as a  LID 
(number 0) but as a DOT. 

Examples: °Â 3040  ¿À 3520  µ§ 3222

o Shape 6:

Characters  such  as »® and Õù where one of the strokes of the square extends 
beyond it,  are not considered to be square (number 6)  shapes,  but  corners 
(number 7). 

Examples: ³î 7710  ½ê 3222  »® 7710  ´Û 8377 µ¹ 3010

o Shape 7:

Only the cornered end of corner shapes (number 7) is counted as 7. 

Examples: ¶è 7171  ¶Ô 7222 ¶ç 2762  È¿ 7124

o Shape 8:

Strokes that cross other strokes are not counted as shape number 8 (È¬). 

Examples: Èþ 8043  ´Ø 7743  Âç 4003  ¼º 8043  ¹Õ 2143  Àí 9043

o Shape 9:

Shapes resembling shape 9, but featuring two strokes in the middle (as in the 
top part of ¶È or ÁÑ) or two strokes on one side (as in ¿å or the bottom part 
of Êé) are not considered as 9 shapes. 

Examples: Êé 4433  ¶È 3290  ÁÑ 3214

8. Some points to note when choosing corners. 

- when a corner is occupied by more than one independant or parallel strokes, 
the one that extend furthest to the left or right is  taken  as  the  corner, 
regardless of how high or low it is. 

examples: Èó 1111  Ðë 2124  ¼À 0013  Äë 0022  ¼Ò 3421  ÌÔ 4721

- if there is another shape above (or, at the bottom of the character, below) 
the  leftmost  or  rightmost  stroke  of  a  character,  that  shape is given 
preference and is taken as the corner. 

examples: »¡ 3090  ¹¬ 4040  á¶ 6020  ½÷ 4040  ã¹ 3521  Â¶ 4480

- when two composite stroke shapes are interwoven and each could be  regarded 
as a corner,  the shape that is higher is taken as the upper corner,  and the 
lower stroke as lower corner. 

- when a stroke that slopes downwards to the left or right  is  supported  by 
another stroke, the latter is taken as the corner. 

examples: ±° 2740  Î¢ 0073  ¾Ë 1962  é° 4464  ·Ô 4410  Èï 3424

- a left slanting stroke on the upper left is taken for the left corner only; 
for the right corner one takes a stroke more to the right. 

examples: ¿È 2740  Ì¶ 2350  ³û 6752  Åª 2762  ½Ü 2762  Åç 2772

9. Shape variations: (Dr App includes several pages of examples) 

10. The fifth corner:

In  order to differentiate between the several characters with the same code, 
an optional "fifth corner" is sometimes used. This is, loosely, a shape above 
the fourth corner which has not been used in any other shape. 


APPENDIX E.  RADICAL-COUNTING RULES
===================================

These rules apply:

(a) to the stroke-counts themselves;

(b) to the stroke counts in the SKIP codes. Where this results in a SKIP
    which differs from that in the NJECD, or in the non-NJECD SKIPs 
    provided by Jack Halpern, the Jack Halpern version is included prefixed
    with "ZR"

The radicals listed below are ones where there are differing approaches to
the counting of radicals in the various references. The stroke counting in
this file does not strictly follow any reference, but tends to more
aligned to Halpern.

1. B140 KUSA-KANMURI e.g. ²× always counted as 3 strokes (Halpern counts 
   this 4 strokes for the (mostly level 2) kanji where the older form is 
   often printed.)

2. B162 SHIN-NYUU e.g. ô£ or °© counted as 3 or 4 strokes. (Nelson and S&H 
   count it as 2 strokes, and Halpern as either 3 or 4.) [See Note 1 below.]

3. B163 OOZATOZUKIRI & B170 KOZATO-HEN Ë® and ïô always counted as 3 strokes
   (Nelson and S&H count it as 2, Halpern as 3.)

4. B199 MUGI Çþ always counted as 7 strokes, except for óÎ & óÏ where it 
   is counted as 11. (Nelson and Halpern do the same, and S&H avoid treating
   it as a radical, but count it as 12 in the remainder.)

5. B113 SHIMESU e.g. Îé, is counted as 4 strokes in that form, and 5 strokes
   in its older form, ã«. 18 kanji are in the 4-stroke form and 20 are in 
   the 5-stroke form. (Nelson and S&H count it as 4; Halpern counts it as 4 
   or 5. [See Note 1.])

6. B184 SHOKU HEN ¿©, µ², etc.is counted as 8 strokes in the µ² form, and as
   9 strokes in the Ò¬ and »Á forms. (Nelson and S&H count it as 8 strokes,
   and Halpern as 8 or 9.) [See Note 1. below.]

7. B131 SHIN/KERAI ¿Ã. Counted as 7 (Nelson counts it as 6, Halpern as 7,
   and S&H as both for different kanji.)

8. B136 MAI ASHI Á¤. Counted as 7 (traditionally counted as 6, in 
   accordance with the older writing of `¥ð'. Nelson counts as 6, S&H as 
   7, and Halpern as 7 for ¾ïÍÑ and ¿ÍÌ¾ÍÑ´Á»ú and 6 for the rest.)

9. B131 SHIN or KERAI ¿Ã. Counted as 7 (traditionally counted as 6). Nelson
   counts as 6, Halpern as 7, and S&H as 6 or 7 in different cases.

Note 1: The JIS X 0208-1990 standard does not formally specify the precise 
   glyphs used for kanji, however the glyphs it uses in the published
   version have become de facto standards for many font compilations. In 
   the published standard, for several kanji, e.g. Ã©/íé, Îé/ã«, µ²/Ò¬, the 
   JIS level one kanji use the simpler form, and the Level 2 kanji use the 
   older more complex form. Just to make matters worse, many fonts for 
   JIS X 0208 kanji are based on the bit-maps specified in JIS X 9051-1984 
   standard, which defines the 16x16 patterns for JIS X 0208-1983 characters. 
   According to Ken Lunde: "This standard was not very good, and JSA is no 
   longer supporting it." 
   Anyway, JIS X 9051-1984 had the simpler form for all these bushu in both 
   Levels 1 and 2, as well as having simplifications of kanji like ßÉ. Thus,
   as the font foundries have freedom to choose whichever glyphs they like, 
   what you see on your screen may well not agree with these rules. All 
   the rules in this appendix relate to the glyphs as published in the 
   JIS X 0208-1990 standard, and as appearing in font compilations based 
   on them.
