Errata for "Understanding Japanese Information Processing"
Fixed in 2nd Printing (First Edition), March 1994

Quote pages (now two pages):

o Removed "Advance Praise" from page header.

o Three quotes added from Jack Halpern, Dr. Joseph Becker, and
  Wolfgang Hadamitzky as follows:

  "As a professional kanji lexicographer, I find Ken Lunde's work a
  treasure-house of information on the complexities of Japanese
  character encoding and processing. I have never encountered a
  single book, even in Japanese, that brings together such a
  wealth of detail with such clarity and precision. Armed with this
  book as my guide, I feel totally confident in undertaking a
  project of prodigious complexity: the development of a
  comprehensive kanji database to serve as a basis for dozens of
  dictionaries and learning aids."

  -- Jack Halpern
     Editor in Chief, "New Japanese-English Character Dictionary"
     Research Fellow, Showa Women's University, Institute of
       Modern Culture

  "Ken Lunde has not only brought together a wealth of vital
  information between these  covers, he has organized the
  complexities of Japanese computing into a clear introduction
  and practical handbook. "Understanding Japanese Information
  Processing" is a treasure for computer system designers
  concerned with multilingual software, as well as for teachers
  and students pursuing computer tools to work with the
  Japanese language."

  -- Dr. Joseph Becker
     Principal Scientist, XSoft/Xerox Corporation

  "The wealth of information, its lucid arrangement including a
  comprehensive index, and its clear and easy-to-understand
  language will make this book an indispensible tool for a wide
  range of people: for the student who is looking for Japanese
  word processing software, teachware, or online dictionary; for
  Japanese specialists who want to exchange Japanese documents
  via floppy disk, e-mail, and so on; and for the programmer
  who needs to write a program related to the Japanese language.
  In short, for everyone who comes in touch with written
  Japanese."

  -- Wolfgang Hadamitzky

       Lookup via Any Kanji"


Page iv:

  field.


Page xx:

Page xxvi:

o Added the following footnote:

  "These abbreviations, such as I18N, come from the letter "I"
  followed by 18 letters followed by the letter "N.""

  The index into the text is at the end of the first sentence of
  the last paragraph.

o Changed the ordering of entries in Table 2-4 to make more sense.
  The first column on p 22 was linked to the first column on p 23 --
  this was changed so that the first column on p 22 was linked to
  the second column on the same page.

o The source kanji for hiragana "ne" (ね) was changed to be the same
  as for katakana "ne" (ネ) -- this caused the kanji 禰 to be removed

Page 24:

o Deleted the space between the asterisk of the footnote and "Some."

Page 46:

o Changed Table 3-17's title to "The KS C 5601-1992 Character Set".


Page 47

o Changed Table 3-18's title to "The GB 2312-80 Character Set".


Page 50:

o Changed "20,902" to "21,000" (to fit with "approximately") in the
  following sentence:

  "...into a single set of approximately 21,000 kanji which support
  Chinese (both simplified and traditional), Japanese, and Korean."

o The following sentence replaces the one immediately after Table 3-21:

  "The actual number of characters in Unicode, as depicted in Table 3-21,
  has been stable for quite some time."

o Added "most of" to the following sentence:

  "According to Volume 2 of The "Unicode Standard: Worldwide Character
  Encoding", most of the kanji contained in the character set standards
  listed in Table 3-22 have been unified."


Page 51:

o The Table 3-22 note now reads as follows (the first sentence was
  deleted):

  "Appendix H shows that there are 4,039 kanji in JEF that are above
  and beyond those in JIS X 0208-1990."


Page 53:

o The following paragraph totally replaces the one that begins and
  ends with "Much of the ... results of Han Unification." This is
  the most detail I could fit without breaking pages. The next
  paragraph points readers to the Unicode books, which provide the
  rest of the details.

  "The result of Han Unification was a set of kanji whose ordering
  can be considered culturally neutral. How kanji are ordered by
  radical is often culture-specific, and devising an ordering that
  would please all cultures that use kanji was a difficult task. The
  Chinese/Japanese/Korean Joint Research Group (CJK-JRG), an ad-hoc
  committee of ISO/IEC JTC1/SC2/WG2 (Joint Technical Committee 1/
  Subcommittee 2/Working Group 2), selected four kanji dictionaries,
  reflecting kanji usage in East Asia: Common tradition (康煕字典),
  Japan, China, and Korea. These four dictionaries were then checked,
  in the order given above, for each kanji. If the first dictionary
  did not have it, the next dictionary was checked. This was done
  until each of the kanji was found."


Page 56:

o Changed "extendable" to "extensible" in the last paragraph.


Page 57:

o The following two paragraphs totally replace what was on this
  page before:

  "What about ISO 10646 and Unicode? The character set defined by
  those standards has been immobile since 1992, and implementations
  are coming on line very quickly. PenPoint by GO Corporation, Plan
  9 by AT&T Bell Laboratories, Windows NT by Microsoft, and Newton
  by Apple are operating systems that currently support Unicode.
  Other manufacturers have similar plans."

  "Here is some history that may be of interest. When JIS C 6226-1978
  was first introduced in Japan in 1978, it was not met with general
  acceptance from industry. The problem was that it did not include
  all the characters found in the major Japanese corporate character
  set standards already in place at the time. In time, JIS C 6226-1978
  became the standard in Japanese industry. The Unicode Consortium,
  on the other hand, made sure that all of the characters from the
  major national standards were included as part of Unicode."


Page 64:

o Removed "also" from the second sentence of the last paragraph.


Page 65:

  to the character set."

  are the emboldened ranges.

Page 86:

o Removed the extraneous period at the end of the first paragraph.


Page 90:

  were changed into the traditional form (one extra stroke). The same
  change was made to the traditional form in the table note.


Page 91:

o Added "(really 31-bit)" after "32-bit form" in the first line of the
  first paragraph.

o Added "(31 bits)" after "32 bits" in the second paragraph.

o The "ISO 10646:UCS-4" section of Table 4-27 was changed to reflect the
  correct ranges for the first and second byte.

  "First byte    0-127   00-7F   000-177"
  "Second byte   0-255   00-FF   000-377"


Page 95:

  paragraph.


Page 147:

o Changed "claim" to "might imagine" in the following sentence:

  "Some might imagine that Unicode is a solution to this problem."

o Deleted "I have found that" from the following sentence:

  "While this appears to be true at first glance (after all, there
  are nearly 21,000 kanji to pick and choose from!), there are
  approximately 1,000 JEF kanji that are not part of the Unicode
  kanji set."


Page 148:

o Added the following paragraph after the first paragraph:

  "More detailed information on Japanese text layout can be found in
  the document JIS X 4051-1993 (Line Composition Rules for Japanese
  Documents)."


Pages 159-161:

o Change "fi" to "fi" ligatures.


Page 163:

o Put the word "kanji" into double quotes -- the paragraph before
  Table 7-2.


Page 165:

o Changed the "Line 5" explanation to truly reflect what the code
  does:

  "The variable celloffset is initialized by testing one or more
  conditions. The first condition is whether the variable adjust
  is equal to 1. If this first condition is not met, celloffset is
  initialized to 126. If this first condition is met, another
  condition is tested. If the variable c2 is greater than 127,
  celloffset will be initialized to 32; 31 otherwise. As c1 is not
  equal to 1 in the example, celloffset is initialized to 126."

  "For those interested in Korean information processing, there is a
  similar document called "Korean Character Encoding for Internet
  Messages," written by Uhhyung Choi, Kilnam Chon, and Hyunje Park.

  mappings. Some of the characters you find in this chapter may
  soon become part of the Unicode character set (if they are not
