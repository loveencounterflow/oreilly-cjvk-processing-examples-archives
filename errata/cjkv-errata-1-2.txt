  However, for Unicode-based applications, it is not quite as simple.
  Although Windows NT supports Unicode, Windows 95 and 98 do not fully
  support Unicode. A Unicode application that runs on Windows NT very
  likely needs to be modified to run on Windows 95 and 98. For
  example, Unicode applications that use Microsoft Foundation Classes
  (MFC) will not initialize properly on Windows 95. There are
  solutions to this dilemma. One is Basis Technology's Cheops product
  (footnote: http://cheops.basistech.com).  Cheops is a compatibility
  layer that allows Windows NT Unicode applications to run on Windows
  95 and 98 using a single set of executables.
