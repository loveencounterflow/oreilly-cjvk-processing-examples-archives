Please note the following conventions used in this manual:

1. This manual is organized in a similar way to NJStar's menu  tree,  unless
   otherwise indicated. Functions are grouped as they are listed in the main
   menu, but not necessarily in the same order. Functions that do not appear
   in the main menu are grouped in related sections.

2. Each function includes a brief explanation,  together  with  the  related
   information.  For instance,  the input method for  Japanese characters is
   described under the function of <RomajiInput> or <KanaKanjiInput>.

3. Under each function, the function name is  given  within  < > signs.  The
   function names may be used for the NJStar key configuration file or macro
   text files. NJStar's standard key  name  for  corresponding  function  is
   presented with [ ] signs, followed by the menu item  display  in Japanese
   and English, if any. If the function is not shown in the menu, a Japanese
   translation and English equivalence is given in ( ) for reference.

4. This manual is written in English, including a  few  Japanese characters,
   and is thus basically ASCII compatible. You may view or  print  it  under
   NJStar. When viewing under other English editors or word processors,  all
   English letters can  be  viewed  properly,  but  Japanese  characters are
   scrambled. If you want to produce a printed copy of this manual  with  an
   English word processor, it is advisable  to  remove  first  the  Japanese
   characters.

5. This manual  is  divided  into  three  files,  NJSTAR1.DOC  (this  file),
   NJSTAR2.DOC, and NJSTAR3.DOC.

6. For the NJStar development  history  and  other  background  information,
   please read README.DOC. For utility programs not covered in the shareware
   version, read  UTILITY.DOC.  For  Updates  made  after  this  manual  was
   written, please read WHATSNEW.XXX. For information on ther products  from
   Hongbo Data Systems, please read PRODUCTS.DOC.

=============================================================================

2. NJSTAR OVERVIEW
==================

This section presents an overview of NJStar 3.0J, as well as  some  concepts
that will be used in the following sections of this manual.

User may start NJStar from any DOS prompt, if the NJStar's sub-directory  is
in the system path statement. NJStar also provides a full range  of  command
line options for opening and editing files.

NJStar's interface includes both pull-down menus  and  a  quick-key  command
system.  All  major  functions  are  re-configurable,  ie.,  capable  to  be
reassigned into user selected keys. NJStar also provides a brief help screen
as a reminder for reconfigured command keys. NJStar's screen colors  can  be
reset by the user.

After entering NJStar, the top portion (18 lines for EGA, 24 lines for  VGA,
or 29 lines for SuperVGA) is referred to as the "editing screen," where  you
can display or edit a file. Under certain input modes however,  the  editing
screen may also be used to enter the input codes  in  order  to  reduce  eye
movement.

The "bottom line" is used mainly for the following purposes:

     A)   Display the current Japanese input mode;
     B)   Accept Japanese input codes;
     C)   Display Japanese characters that can be used for input;
     D)   Display the Status of macro operation mode; and
     E)   Display the Status of JASCII (full-size English character) mode.
     F)   Display the Time Clock when JASCII mode is off.

The bottom line may also be used for:

     A)   Report file or system status;
     B)   Report operation results;
     C)   Report error messages; and
     D)   Accept input of the operational variables.

There are two different concepts of "line" in NJStar. One is called  "Screen
Line," a line as shown on the screen. The other is  "Hard  Line,"  a  string
ending with a [Return] character. Often, a hard line is called a  paragraph.
We will specify the exact meaning of "line" in the context where appropriate.

Under NJStar, the maximum size of a single  file  is  64K,  that  is,  65536
bytes. However, users may open several files simultaneously.  When  multiple
files are opened  for  editing,  a  "File  Ring"  is  established  for  file
management. The file displayed on the screen is known as the "Current File".
A file ring looks like the following  diagram,  with  files  arranged  in  a
counter-clockwise order:

                        FILENAME.1 <-----  Current File
                        /       \
                      /           \
                    /               \
              FILENAME.2 ---------> FILENAME.3

When a new file is opened, it will be added to the file ring,  next  to  the
current file. The newly-opened file will become the current  file.  See  the
following diagram,


     Current File --->   FILENAME.4  <--------  FILENAME.1
                            |                      ^
                            |                      |
                            v                      |
                         FILENAME.2   ------->  FILENAME.3


There is no limit to the number of files in the file ring, as  long  as  the
computer can provide enough memory to manage it.  NJStar's  file  management
functions make it very easy to control a single file or a bunch of files. In
addition to these functions invoked by the user,  NJStar  can  automatically
save the current file to prevent any  unexpected  interruption,  such  as  a
power failure. NJStar also keeps a .BAK file for the user when saving a file
which has been modified.

Many operations also refer to "current  screen",  "current  line",  "current
string", or, "current character". By the same token, that means the  screen,
line, string or character the cursor is pointed at.  However,  the  "current
block" means the block that is set in the current file, no matter  where  it
is located.

When inputting Japanese characters, NJStar prior to V3.0j uses Romaji as the
primary input method. When the  user  enters  an  input  code,  NJStar  will
display one or  a list of matched characters at the bottom  line.  The  user
can  select  the desired character in order to paste  it  into  the  editing
screen.

In addition to Romaji, NJStar 3.0J  now  includes  the  on-line  version  of
Romaji input called "Kana-Kanji" as well as 10 other popular input  methods,
such as English to Japanese, Radical and  ASCII.  Users may  choose  to  use
other input methods as a primary one.

NJStar's editing functions, including cursor locating, text copying, moving,
deleting, as well as undeleting commands, make  it  possible  to  manipulate
text in the way preferred by the user. Complete block functions  make  those
editing tasks even easier, especially for exchanging data  between  multiple
files. NJStar's macros also add the feasibility to create shortcuts for many
tasks.

When printing, you do not have to leave NJStar. A file can be printed  to  9
pin, 24 pin dot matrix printers, laser printers, as well as  other  printers
from the NJStar editor. NJStar's  print  format  commands  enable  users  to
customize the page layout whenever necessary. User may specify the range  of
page numbers to print and the  output  devices  for  printing.  NJStar  also
provides many  file conversion capabilities to enhance information  exchange
in Japanese.

For a more  detailed  description  of  NJStar's  functions  and  operational
procedures, please read the following text.

=============================================================================

3. PROGRAM USAGE
================

This section describes NJStar's usage, and its command line options.

To invoke NJStar from the DOS  prompt,  make  sure  that  the  NJStar  files
(NJSTAR.EXE and other auxiliary files) are  in  the current sub-directory or
accessible through the system path  statement.  The  following  is  a  brief
presentation about NJStar usage and command line options:

PROGRAM   NJSTAR.EXE

     [USAGE]
          NJSTAR [options] [filename, filename, ... filenames] [+linenum]

     [OPTIONS]
          -?/h    - Help information
          -e      - Use EGA 19 line display for VGA monitor
          -m      - Use MonoEGA, MonoVGA/MCGA (640x480x2)
          -s      - Use predefined Super VGA monitor
          -r      - Open files as Read Only, so can not save
          -d      - Automatically display a file until [Ctrl+C] pressed
          -j      - Set Shift-JIS as default file format
          -lmacro - Load Macro from file "macro.NJM" into macro buffer
          -xmacro - Load  Macro from file  "macro.NJM" into macro
                    buffer and then execute the macro once

     Filename: For any file(s) to be edited. More than one filename  can  be
               entered at a command line. DOS wildcards, * or ?, can be used
               as part of filename. The drive name and the full path can  be
               added to the file if necessary. If the  file  name  does  not
               exist on the disk, a new file will be opened under this name.
               NJStar adds the ".jis" file extension if none  is  specified.
               If no filename is entered, NJStar will open an  unnamed  area
               for editing.

     +linenum: [linenum] points to the line where the cursor will be located
               after the file is opened. The line is  understood  as  string
               ending with a [Return] character, not a screen line.  If  the
               line number is greater  than  the  last  line's  number,  the
               cursor will be located at the end of the  file.  The  special
               line number, "+$" will position the cursor at the end of  the
               file. If no line number is entered, the cursor will be at the
               beginning of the file.

     [EXAMPLES]

          C:\NJJ30> NJSTAR njstar.doc +200 njstar +$

          C:\NJJ30> NJSTAR *.doc *.txt

          C:\NJJ30> NJSTAR -e njstar.doc

          C:\NJJ30> NJSTAR -v *.tx?

          C:\NJJ30> NJSTAR -j -lmymac osaka.jis

Please note that for  NJStar's  auxiliary  files,  only  font  (jis*.*)  and
dictionary (*.dic) files can be located on a directory other  than  NJStar's
home directory. If this is the case, you must use DOS environment variables,
NJZK and NJDIC, to identify the location of font and dictionary  files.  For
example, if the font files  are  located  in  C:\NJJ30\FONT  and  dictionary
files in C:\NJJ30\DIC, add the following lines to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

          SET NJZK=C:\NJJ30\FONT
          SET NJDIC=C:\NJJ30\DIC

Alternatively, those two variables can also  be  defined  in  NJSTAR.INI  by
adding these two lines:

          NJZK=C:\NJJ30\FONT
          NJDIC=C:\NJJ30\DIC

The SET commands in AUTOEXEC.BAT override definitions in NJSTAR.INI.

By defining NJZK and NJDIC in NJSTAR.INI or as  environment  variables,  you
can avoid the need for multiple copies of fonts  and  dictionaries  on  hard
disk when multiple versions of NJStar are installed. Those two variables are
also used by all programs based on the NJSDK Japanese  software  development
kits.

=============================================================================

4. MENU AND HELP
================

This section describes NJStar's Menu system and online Help functions. These
functions are located under "Help" (ヘルプ) in the  main  menu,  except  the
<Menu> function.

FUNCTION   <Menu>   [ESC]        (メニュー   Main menu)

This function will call up NJStar's pull-down menu.

The following is the Menu Tree in English. Due to limited space, some  items
are abbreviated arbitrarily.

In ASCII mode, or in any Japanese input mode without  a  Japanese  character
selected in the bottom line, press [ESC] to call up the menu.

Mouse users can position the mouse pointer at the top line of the screen and
click the mouse's left button once to call up the menu.

When the main menu is displayed, use the cursor keys or the mouse pointer to
select a main menu item. Press [Return] or click the left mouse button once,
to activate a pull-down submenu under the main menu item. If the  system  is
currently in English, enter the first letter of the  desired  menu  item  to
call up the submenu.

Submenu item selection operates in the same way as the main menu  items.  If
the system is currently in English, enter the first  upper  case  letter  in
the menu item to execute the menu item command.

To turn off the main menu, press [ESC] key,  or  click the left mouse button
once while the mouse pointer is pointing to any location outside the current
menu area.

FUNCTION   <EnglishMenu>  [Ctrl+M]    メニュー切替    ENGLISH

Toggles between Japanese and English menu system. Please note the  different
meaning for the menu item. That  is, it offers  "English  Menu"  when  under
Japanese mode, and vice versa. Once switched, it also  resets  the  language
for the help screen and the system messages and prompts.

FUNCTION   <QuickHelp>   [F1]       ヘルプ           Quick Help

Displays NJStar's Quick Help screen. The content of the default help  screen
may be found in KANJI.HLP (in Japanese) and NJCONFIG.HLP (in English).

There are 24 lines in the help screen, with up  to  80  characters  in  each
line. Only 18 Lines can be displayed on EGA screens at  one  time,  but  the
rest 6 lines will be displayed after the first screen. If you have  modified
KANJI.HLP / NJCONFIG.HLP, or you want to  use  your  own  help  screen,  run
NJCONFIG.EXE in order to write a new Help screen  into  NJSTAR.NJJ.  A  help
screen file can have 80 characters per line and up to 24  line  maximum.  It
must be in ASCII format or EUC format. 

Pressing the mouse middle button at the bottom line also  invokes  the  help
function. After viewing the help screen, you can press any key to go back to
the current editing screen.

=============================================================================

5. FILE MANAGEMENT
==================

This section describes NJStar's file  management  functions.  All  functions
listed here can be found under "File" (文書) in the top menu.

FUNCTION   <EditFile>      [F8]             文書の読出し     Load File

Opens a user specified file on disk, and place it into the File  Ring  after
the current file. NJStar will then switch  to  the  newly  opened  file  and
display it as the new current file. The file from  which  the  function  was
initiated remains in the File Ring as the previous file.

When executing this function, NJStar will prompt for a file  name.  You  may
enter a filename at the prompt, DOS wild cards (*,?) can be  used, including
the drive name and full path if necessary. Alternatively, you can press [F1]
to list all the files in the current sub-directory in a pop-up window.

From the pop-up file list window, you can select a file with the cursor keys
or the mouse. Sub-directory items are listed before  the  file  name.  "\.."
indicates a parent directory  for  the  current  sub-directory.  "(NewFile)"
opens an "untitled" file. Other drive letters, if any, would be given at the
end of the list, such as [A:], [B:]. The [DEL] key will delete a highlighted
file, (not a sub-directory), from the disk after confirmation.

When the list extends beyond the window, you can use the down arrow  key  or
[PgDn] to scroll through the list. With a mouse, click  the  left  or  right
button and drag the mouse to scroll the list.

Before switching to the newly-opened file,  NJStar  checks  to  see  if  the
current file has been modified. You have to confirm whether or not to save a
modified file. If you answer [N]o, the modifications  in  the  current  file
will be abandoned. At any point, press [ESC] to cancel the request.

If the current file is an "untitled" file, the system will not ask  for  the
filename until you are ready to save the file.

When loading a file, NJStar can automatically detect a range  of  7-bit  JIS
codes (Old-JIS, New-JIS, NEC-JIS), and save to original code.  It  can  also
detect Shift-JIS (8-bit) if the "Shift-JIS" auto detection is switched on in
NJCONFIG 'G' option. But since EUC and Shift-JIS share some  coding  spaces,
there could be some errors. If you are sure that the file is Shift-JIS,  use
option '-j' at NJStar's command line.

FUNCTION   <OpenFile>     [Ctrl+O]      オープン      Open File

Invokes the <EditFile>+[F1] key function. No filename is  asked.  To  invoke
this function with the mouse, press the right button on any portion  of  the
bottom line. See description under  Function  <EditFile>  for  more  details
about operations in the pop-up file list window.

FUNCTION   InsertFile    [Ctrl+I]       (文書の挿入    Insert File)

This function is implemented as a macro in NJCONFIG.KEY.

This function will insert a second file to the location where the cursor  is
pointed to. When you start this function, it will bring up a  file  list  as
described in <EditFile>. User may select a file to be opened, or press [ESC]
to cancel the operation. The content of the inserted file will be marked  in
reverse video.

Since NJStar limits the file size to 64K, it is advisable not  to  insert  a
file that won't fit into the current file. To be safe, you should  save  the
current file before you insert another file of unknown length.

FUNCTION   <NextFile>     [F10]      次の文書へ            Next File

When editing multiple files, this function will move to the next file in the
File Ring and then present that file as the  current  file.  The  file  from
which the function was initiated remains in the File Ring  as  the  previous
file.

Before leaving the current file, NJStar may check to see if the current file
is modified. You must confirm whether to save the modified file or  not.  If
you answer [N]o, modifications will be abandoned. Press [ESC] to cancel  the
request.

FUNCTION   <PrevFile>     [Alt+F10]    前の文書へ          Prev File

When editing multiple files, this function will move to the previous file in
the File Ring and then present that file as the current file. The file  from
which the function was initiated remains in the File Ring as the next  file.
(Please see <NextFile>.)

FUNCTION   <FileList>      [Shift+F10]   文書一覧           File List

When editing multiple files, this function will display a pop-up window with
all filenames in the current File  Ring.  The  current  file  name  will  be
listed as the first item and the others listed in  the  order  of  the  File
Ring. A file can be picked up from this list without changing the  order  of
the File Ring.

When the list displays, use the cursor key to select a  filename,  and  then
press [Return] to open that file. Or, you can use the mouse pointer to point
to the filename and then click the left button  once  to  select  the  file.
Press [ESC] to select no file and go back to the  current  file.  Otherwise,
when a file is selected, NJStar will check the modification in  the  current
file. If there are any unsaved modifications, the system  will  ask  you  to
save the file if necessary. (Please see <EditFile>.)

If there is no Japanese character at the bottom line waiting to be selected,
point the mouse pointer at the middle section of the bottom  line  and  then
click the left button once to invoke this function.

FUNCTION   <RenameFile>      [F7]       文書名変更         Rename File

Renames the current file  to  a  user  specified  name,  without  saving  it
immediately.

The program will prompt you to enter the new filename, with drive  name  and
full path if necessary. NJStar prompts to confirm the name if the file  name
exists already. The request can be cancelled by pressing [ESC].

FUNCTION   <SaveFile>        [F2]       文書の保管      Save File

Saves the current file to disk under its current file  name.  If  NJStar  is
configured to produce a '.BAK' file on saving, it will produce a backup file
with a .BAK extension name. ie. the disk file with  the  same  name  as  the
current file is renamed to *.BAK.

If disk is full or the file is read only, an error message will be displayed
on the bottom line.

FUNCTION   <File>    [F4]               (文書           File)

Closes the current file and withdraw it from the File Ring.  When  quitting,
it saves the current file to disk. If there was only one file  open,  NJStar
exits to DOS. Otherwise, it goes to the next file in the File Ring.

If the disk is full or the file is  read-only,  an  error  message  will  be
displayed in the bottom line and NJStar will prompt to quit. If the disk  is
full, you can change to another disk. If the current file is read-only,  the
message "This file is Read Only, can't save!" is displayed. You have to  use
<RenameFile> to rename the current file to another filename, then use <File>
or <SaveFile> again, or use <SaveEUC> function (found under OUTPUT) to  save
it under a different filename.

FUNCTION   <SaveAll>     [Ctrl+F4]       全て保管          Save All

When editing multiple files, this function will save  the  current  file  to
disk. All files are released from the File Ring and you can exit to DOS.  If
it fails to save files, it stops before quitting. (Please see <File>.)

FUNCTION   <QuitFile>     [F3]           文書を終了        Close File

Exits from the current file  without  asking  to  save  the  file  to  disk.
However, if the current file has been modified, you will be prompted to save
the file. Press [Y] to keep modifications, or [N] to quit. If there is  only
one file open, NJStar quits to DOS; otherwise, it opens the next file in the
File Ring.

FUNCTION   <QuitAll>      [Ctrl+F3]      全て終了          Exit All

When editing multiple files, this  function  exits  from  the  current  file
without a Save option. However, if the current file has  been  modified,  it
will prompt for the optional Save. (Please see <QuitFile>.)

FUNCTION   <DOS>          [Ctrl+D]       DOS コマンド      DOS Command

Executes a user specified DOS command. When finished, it will switch back to
NJStar. This command is very useful in macro commands. Users can access  any
external program to perform some tasks (such as spelling checking) which are
not available in NJStar.

FUNCTION   <Shell>        [Ctrl+S]       DOS シェル       DOS Shell

Shells out to DOS. NJStar's DOS shell occupies very little  RAM  and  leaves
enough memory for most DOS operations. In NJStar's shell, the  DOS's  prompt
shows <NJ>, for example:

C:\NJJ30\><NJ> _

Remember to type "EXIT" to return to NJStar once you have finished with DOS.

=============================================================================

6. CURSOR MOVEMENTS
===================

This section describes NJStar's cursor movements. Some of them  are  located
under "Search" (検索) in the main menu.

Mouse: point the mouse pointer to any position in the screen, except the top
line, and then click the left button once to  relocate  the  cursor  on  the
current screen.

FUNCTION   <CursorLeft>    [LEFT]        (左方へ         Left)

Moves the cursor to  the  previous  character.  If  the  cursor  is  on  the
beginning of the current line, the cursor  will  move  to  the  end  of  the
previous line. If the cursor is on the top left of the  screen,  the  screen
display will scroll up one line.

FUNCTION   <CursorRight>   [RIGHT]       (右方へ         Right)

Scrolls the screen display up line by line  towards  the  beginning  of  the
file. Please notice that the  cursor's  relative  position  on  the  current
screen will not be changed.

Mouse: point the mouse pointer at any position of the current screen, except
the top line, and then drag the mouse up to scroll the screen up.

FUNCTION   <ScrollDown>   [Alt+DOWN]       (下へスクロル      Scroll Down)

Scrolls the screen display down line by line, to the end of  the  file.  The
cursor's relative position at the current screen will not be changed.

Mouse: point the mouse pointer at any position of the current screen, except
the top line, and then drag the mouse down to scroll the screen down.

FUNCTION   <GotoLine>      [Ctrl+F6]        指定行へ           Goto Line

Moves the cursor to a user specified line and then redisplay the  screen  if
necessary. A line here is a hard line.

When NJStar asks for a line number, you can enter one of the following:

        Line #    Results
        ======    ====================================================
        100       Go to the 100th line
        +50       Forward 50 lines from the current line
        -20       Back up 20 lines from the current line
         $        Go to the end of the file
        9999      When line number exceeded, go to end-of-file

=============================================================================

7. FILE EDITING
===============

This section describes NJStar's basic editing commands. Please read the next
two sections for Search/Replace and Block Operations. Some functions  listed
below can be found under "Editing Function" (編集) in the main menu.

FUNCTION   <Enter>         [ENTER]          (リターン           Return)

Inserts a [Return] character at the end of the current line  and  then  move
the cursor to the beginning of the next new line.

This function is also used to end user input in many other  cases,  such  as
search strings, filenames, printing variables, etc.

FUNCTION <HardReturn>  [GREYENTER] or [Shift+ENTER] (エンター  HardReturn)

Inserts a [Return] character into the search  string.  The  display  of  the
[Return] character depends on user's setting for End  of  Line  symbol.  The
default is ASCII character 20.

In some Japanese input modes which require only numerical  keys  on  keypad,
such as  "Stroke", this  function  may  be  used  for  selecting  the  first
character in the bottom line.

For other situations, this function is the same as <Enter>.

FUNCTION   <Space>        [SpaceBar]        (スペース        Space)

Enters a space character  into  the  current  file.  If  the  system  is  in
non-JASCII mode, it enters an ASCII space  character.  Otherwise,  it enters
two ASCII space characters.

When the bottom line has Japanese characters waiting to  be  selected,  this
function selects the first character. To input a space in  this  case,  user
should use ALT+Space or CTRL+Space.

NOTE: <Space> is not a configurable function.

FUNCTION   <DelChar>       [DEL]            (文字の削除     Del Char)

Deletes the character at the current cursor position. If the current  cursor
is at the end of a line, the End of Line character, ie., [Return] character,
will be deleted so the next line will be joined to the current line.

FUNCTION   <BackSpace>     [BS]             (バックスペース       BackSpace)

Deletes the character before the current cursor  position.  If  the  current
cursor is at the beginning of a  line,  the  previous  line's  End  of  Line
character will be deleted so the current line will be joined to the previous
line.

FUNCTION   <DelLine> [Ctrl+BackSpace] /[Ctrl+Y]  この行を削除    Del Line

Deletes the current screen line, including the End of Line character.

FUNCTION   <DelToBegLine>  [Ctrl+J]         行頭まで削除     Del to Beg Line

Deletes all characters up to the beginning of the current screen  line,  not
including the character at the current cursor position. If the cursor is  at
the beginning of a line, it will do nothing.

FUNCTION   <DelToEndLine>  [Ctrl+K] or [Ctrl+E] 行末まで削除 Del to End Line

Deletes all characters from the current cursor position to the  end  of  the
current screen line, not including the End of Line  character.  However,  if
the current line is a blank line, or the cursor is at the end of a line, the
End of Line character will be deleted.

FUNCTION   <UnDelLine>     [F9]             削除の回復       UnDelete

Recovers the most recently deleted text by any  of  the  deleting  functions
listed above,  and  insert  the  recovered  text  into  the  current  cursor
position.

If one or more  deleting  functions  are  used  without  interruptions,  all
deleted text  could  be  recovered  by  this  function.  However,  if  other
non-deleting functions are invoked in between deleting, such as  moving  the
cursor, only the latest deleted text could be recovered.

FUNCTION   <DupLine>       [Ctrl+L]         この行を複写      Dup Line

Duplicates the current screen line to the  next  line,  and  then  move  the
cursor down to the next line.

FUNCTION   <TimeDate>      [Ctrl+T]         日付けと時刻      Time & Date

Inserts the current system date and time into the editing screen in Japanese
format. Time/Date will appear  as  Year,  Month,  Day,  Hours,  Minutes  and
Seconds. For example: 1994 年 2 月 3 日  木曜日  11:29:04

The system clock has to be set for  this  function  to  return  the  correct
Time/Date.

FUNCTION  <FileName>       [Ctrl+X+N]       文書名の貼付け    File Name

Inserts the current filename, together with the full path, into the  editing
screen, or into the prompt string on the bottom line when used in a macro.

FUNCTION  <ToggleEOL>      [Ctrl+F9]        行末マーク        Toggle EOL

Toggles the display of End of Line symbols at the editing screen. The symbol
character and the initial display status can be defined  with  NJCONFIG.EXE.
The default symbol is ASCII character 20, and the default display status  is
off.

FUNCTION  <FileStatus>     [Ctrl+F1]        文書について      File Status

Displays the status of the current file, such  as  file  type,  name,  size,
number of Japanese characters (including all the  two-byte characters),  and
number of hard lines, at the bottom  line.
The current cursor position, in terms of line and column, is also displayed.

FUNCTION  <WordCount>      [Ctrl+F5]        語句の統計        Word Count

Counts the frequency of a user specified string, within a block or from  the
current cursor position to the end of the file. The result will be displayed
at the bottom line. This function can also be used within a marked block.

When this function is invoked, it will prompt for a string  to  be  counted.
The string may be any type of text in the file and any relevant input method
can be used to input Japanese or other characters. If this function, or  any
one of searching functions, was called earlier, the system will prompt  with
the previously entered string. In this case, press [Ctrl+BackSpace] to clear
the existing string, or use other keys to edit the string. When ready, press
[Return] key to accept the string. (The <HardReturn> key is  used  to  enter
the End of Line symbol in the string.) Press [ESC] key at any time to cancel
the counting request.

FUNCTION   <ListDir>       [Shift+F9]         ディレクトリ       List Dir

Lists files in a sub-directory, as well as the total file  number  and  free
disk space. You can specify the drive, path, or  file  name,  if  necessary.
After viewing the directory, press any key to go back to the editing screen.

FUNCTION   <Keyboard>      (not assigned by default)

This function enables you to select  a  different  keyboard,  e.g.  English,
French, German and Swedish-Danish-Norwegian. The default  keyboard  is  also
configurable through NJCONFIG's General option. This command is only  useful
when no other keyboard driver is installed.

International keyboard support (any countries supported by DOS) is available
through the MS-DOS keyboard driver. The Keyboard driver should be  installed
before starting NJStar. However,  since  ASCII  161-254  are  used  to  code
Japanese characters, the special characters in this range will  be  ignored.
Note that ASCII 225 (beta) is remapped as ASCII 158 in NJStar.

With the International keyboard support, the <keyboard> command is no longer
necessary. This command is provided for compatibility with V2.1, and may  be
removed in future version.

8. SEARCH AND REPLACE
=====================

This section describes NJStar's Search and Replace functions.  All  of  them
are located under "Search" (検索) in the main menu.

FUNCTION   <Search>        [F5]             検索           Search

Searches a user specified string, beginning at the current  cursor  position
and to the end-of-file. When the first match is found, the  cursor  will  be
relocated to the beginning of the string and the screen may  be  redisplayed
if necessary. If no match is found, a  message  will  be  displayed  at  the
bottom line.

The string to be searched may be any type of text.  Please  see  <WordCount>
for entering the search string.

FUNCTION   <SearchForward> [Ctrl+F]         下方へ検索       Search Forward

Searches for a string, from the current cursor position to the  end  of  the
file. When the first match is found, the cursor will  be  relocated  to  the
beginning of the string and the screen may be redisplayed and  centered.  If
no match is found, a message will be displayed on the bottom line.

Unlike the <Search> function, this function will not  prompt  for  a  search
string if a previous search string exists in the buffer.

FUNCTION   <SearchBackward>  [Ctrl+B]       上方へ検索      Search Backward

Searches for a string, from  the  character  prior  to  the  current  cursor
position, to the beginning of the file. If a match is found, the cursor will
be relocated  to  the  beginning  of  the  string  and  the  screen  may  be
redisplayed and centered. If no match is found, a message will be  displayed
on the bottom line.

With NJCONFIG.EXE, users can set up this function to accept user input for a
search string or not.  If  user  input  is  expected,  or  if  there  is  no
previously entered string, you can enter a search string at the prompt.

FUNCTION   <SearchReplace>  [F6]            置換え         Replace

This function will search for a user specified string and  replace  it  with
another, starting from the current cursor position to the  end-of-file.  The
system will prompt separately for the search string and the replace  string.
As with other search functions, previous entered search or  replace  strings
will be used for prompts.

After you enter a string, the system starts to search for it. If a match  is
found, the cursor will move to the beginning of the string  and  redraw  the
screen. This prompt will appear on the bottom line:

          Replace: (Yes/No/Go/Only/Quit)?

Enter one of (Y/N/G/O/Q) to proceed. The options are:

          [Y]es  -  Replace this string  and then continue to
                    search  for the next one.  
          [N]o   -  Do  not replace this string, but continue to 
                    search for the next one.  
          [G]o   -  Replace  all matching strings found to the
                    end of file, without confirmation.  
          [O]nly -  Replace this string only and then stop.  
          [Q]uit -  Don't replace anything and stop.

The system will report the result on the bottom line,  whether  a  match  is
found or not.

This function can be used to search and replace in a marked block.

FUNCTION   <Replace>                  (全て置換え        Auto Replace)

Carries out Search and Replace without confirmation. It is  mainly  designed
for use in Macros. No default key is assigned to this function.

9. BLOCK OPERATION
==================

This section describes NJStar's block handling functions.  These  functions,
except <SaveBlock>, are located under "Block" (指定域)  in  the  main  menu.
<SaveBlock> is located under "File" in the main menu.

FUNCTION   <MarkBlock>     [Alt+B]           指定域設定    Mark Block

A block is a segment of file that is deliberately  marked  in  order  to  be
processed separately. This function will mark the character in  the  current
cursor position as the start or end of  a  block.  Mouse:  click  the  right
button once to set the mark.

A segment of file is marked as a block by using this function twice; at  the
beginning and the end of the block. A marked block is displayed  in  reverse
video and/or different color. You can change the block  display  style  with
NJCONFIG.EXE.

NJStar recognizes only one block at a time. After a block is marked,  it  is
possible to change its range by invoking the <MarkBlock> function again.

Block marks will be released automatically when switching to another file.

FUNCTION   <MarkLine>      [Alt+L]          行を指定       Mark Line

Marks the current screen line as the start or end of a  block.  If  a  block
exists, this function will change  its  range.  Mouse:  press  middle  mouse
button or double click the right button to use this function.

FUNCTION   <MarkWord>      [Alt+W]          一語を指定     Mark Word

Marks the current word if the cursor is at an English word, or mark  two  or
more Japanese characters if the cursor is pointing at a  Japanese  word.  An
existing block will be released.

FUNCTION   <DefWordSet>    [Alt+Q]         語長リセット    Default Word Set

Sets the default character set for <MarkWord>,  <WordLeft>  and  <WordRight>
as: A-Z, a-z, 0-9 and underline '_', and Japanese characters

FUNCTION   <AltWordSet>    [Alt+A]         語長セット   Alternative Word Set

Sets  the  alternative  character  set  for   <MarkWord>,   <WordLeft>   and
<WordRight> as:

         A-Z, a-z, 0-9 and underline '_', and Japanese characters
         PLUS  ! # $ %  & ` ' ( ) - . / \ @ { } ~ : ^

<DefWordSet> and <AltWordSet> are mainly used by  macros.  For  example,  by
default, <MarkWord> could not mark a filename such as  THISFILE.TXT, but the
following macro can be used to mark a filename and open the file:

Meta+W Macro AltWordSet Markword DefWordSet Copy EditFile Paste Enter

When marking Japanese characters, each <AltWordSet> will increase the length
of marking by one character. <DefWordSet>  will  reset  the  length  to  two
Japanese characters.  The following  macro  uses  <MarkWord>  to  mark  four
Japanese characters and call EDICT:

Meta+W Macro AltWordSet AltWordSet Markword DefWordSet EDicLookup

FUNCTION   <UnMarkBlock>   [Alt+U]          指定の解除     Unmark Block

Releases the current block by unmarking it. Mouse: click the left and  right
button at the same time to invoke this function.

FUNCTION   <MoveBlock>     [Alt+M]          指定域の移動   Move Block

Moves the current block to  the  location  immediately  before  the  current
cursor position in the same file. The block mark will stay with the block.

FUNCTION   <CopyBlock>     [Alt+C]          複写と貼付    Copy Block

Copies the current block to the  location  immediately  before  the  current
cursor position. The block mark will be released from the original location,
moving to the newly copied text.

If there is no block defined in  the  current  file,  it  will  restore  the
content in the internal block buffer, stored by either <Copy> or <DelBlock>.

This function can be used to copy a marked block from  one  opened  file  to
another one, without the block mark.

FUNCTION   <Copy>          [Ctrl+W]         複写          Copy 

Stores the current block in the internal block buffer. The block  mark  will
be released. The stored block can be copied into a file with  <Paste>.  This
pair of functions allows to exchange text between files.

FUNCTION   <Paste>         [Alt+Y]          貼付け        Paste

Restores  the  content  of  the  internal  block  buffer  in  the   location
immediately before the current cursor position. The restored text is  marked
as a block.

Since this function restores the content of the internal  block  buffer,  it
can actually restore the content of a deleted  block,  or  copy  the  latest
marked block in a file.

FUNCTION   <DelBlock>      [Alt+D]          指定域の削除      Del Block

Deletes the current marked block, and store it in the internal block buffer.
The  deleted  block  can  be  recovered  with   <UnDelBlock>,   <Paste>   or
<CopyBlock>. Only the last deleted block can be recovered.

FUNCTION   <UnDelBlock>    [Alt+Y]          削除の回復      Undelete Block

Recovers a deleted block, in the location  immediately  before  the  current
cursor position. The recovered block will  be  displayed  and  marked  as  a
block.

This function is functionally the same as  <Paste>,  but  with  a  different
concept. The default key is the same as <Paste>.

FUNCTION   <GotoBlock>     [Alt+G]         指定域へ            Goto Block

Moves the cursor to the beginning of the marked  block,  and  redisplay  the
screen.

FUNCTION   <SaveBlock>     [Alt+S]         指定域の保管        Save Block

Saves a marked block to a file, with a user specified filename.  The default
filename is the current filename with the  ".BLK"  extension,  and  you  can
enter any valid filename, with drive name and full  path  if  necessary.  If
the filename exists on disk, the system will ask for confirmation  to  avoid
accidentally overwriting the disk file. In any case, NJStar  will  save  the
overwritten file to a .BAK file if the backup option is  on.  This  function
always saves the marked block in the same file format as the original.

If there is no block marked, this function will call <SaveEUC>  function  to
save the whole file.
