NJSTAR is a Japanese word processor for IBM PC and compatibles. It  supports
the input, display and printing of Japanese characters on the  standard  IBM
computers. NJSTAR features a user friendly  user  interface,  very  easy  to
use. If you want do Japanese word processing or want to  learn  Japanese  on
computer, then NJSTAR is the right software for you.

Many hours of work  have  gone  into  the  development  of  NJSTAR,  and  I
regularly incorporate suggested changes into the product as I am  able  to.
The only way I can continue to provide products like NJSTAR  and  to  offer
outstanding technical support, is for you to register your copy of  NJSTAR.

can do so only through registrations of NJSTAR. Please don't take this  the
wrong way - try  out  NJSTAR  for  30  days  or  so,  under  no  obligation
whatsoever. But if you found it is useful and continue to use it after that
30-day period, please send your bank check for your registration copy to:

following formula:
