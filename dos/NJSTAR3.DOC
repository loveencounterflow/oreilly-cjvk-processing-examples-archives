14. FILE CONVERSION
===================

This section describes several file conversion options provided  by  NJStar.
All items listed here can be found under "Output" (出力)  in  the main menu.

NJStar  uses  the  EUC  (Enhanced  Unix  Code)  coding  standard,   but  can
automatically detect all the 7-bit JIS codes described below.

A file can also be output in any format at the user's choice,  regardless of
what JIS code the file was  originally  written  in,  through  the many file
conversion capabilities that NJStar provides.

FUNCTION   <PcxSaveFile>   [Shift+F5]      PCX作成        Create PCX

Creates a set of PCX files (one file per page) from the  current  file.  The
purpose of this function is mainly to help users  to  send  a  JIS file  via
computerized fax equipment.

A JIS file is normally not supported by fax software. But PCX is  a  popular
graphic format, supported by many fax software packages. This  function  can
be used  to  convert  the  current  file  to  PCX  files,  to  be  sent  via
computerized fax equipment.

Since PCX is primarily a  graphics  format,  any  graphic  editor,  such  as
Windows PaintBrush, can be used to edit the resultant graphic files.

UTILITY   JIS2PCX.EXE

<PcxSaveFile> uses 16x16 fonts to produce PCX files.  This  utility  program
uses better fonts that are provided in the  registered  version  to  produce
PCX  files  in  higher  resolution.  Registered  users  please   check   the
UTILITY.DOC file for more details about this program.

FUNCTION   <SaveEUC>          [Shift+F1]      EUC保管   Save as EUC

Saves current file to disk in EUC-JIS (8-bit) format,  the  format  used  by
UNIX system. The system will  prompt  user  to  enter  a  filename.  If  the
filename is a duplicate of an existing file, the system will ask to  confirm
the operation.

FUNCTION   <SaveNewJIS>       [Shift+F2]      新-JIS保管   Save as New-JIS

Saves current file to disk in New-JIS (7-bit) format. The system will prompt
user to enter a filename. If the filename is  a  duplicate  of  an  existing
file, the system will ask to confirm the operation. Use this file format  if
you intend to send your file with any email package on the network.

FUNCTION   <SaveOldJIS>       [Shift+F3]     旧-JIS保管    Save as Old-JIS

Saves current file to disk in Old-JIS (7-bit) format. The system will prompt
user to enter a filename. If the filename is a duplicate of an existing file,
the system will ask to confirm the operation.

FUNCTION   <SaveNecJIS>       [Shift+F4]     NEC-JIS保管   Save as NEC-JIS

Saves current file to disk in NEC-JIS (7-bit) format. The system will prompt
user to enter a filename. If the filename is a duplicate of an existing file,
the system will ask to confirm the operation.

FUNCTION   <SaveShiftJIS>     [Shift+F6]     シフト-JIS保管  Save as ShiftJIS

Saves current file to disk in Shift-JIS (8-bit) format, the format currently
used by PCs (DOS/V) and Apple Macintosh. The  system  will  prompt  user  to
enter a filename. If the filename is a duplicate of an  existing  file,  the
system will ask to confirm the operation.

NJStar has the ability to coding European characters (ASCII  range  128-160)
but  Shift-JIS uses this space for different purpose. So  make sure  not  to
save the file in Shift-JIS if the document contains such characters.

=============================================================================

You  may  use  NJStar  to  write  a  key  assignment,  reassigning  NJStar's
configurable functions to  user-specified  keys.  Here  are  some  important
points (see NJCONFIG.KEY for an example):

     1. Use EUC format (or ASCII) format for the key assignment file;

     2. Comment lines in the key assignment file start with "*" characters;

     3. Use function names in English as listed in Appendix 1;

     4. Use the standard key names and button names listed in Appendix 2;

     5. A function may be assigned to more than one key. But  if  more  than
        one function is assigned to the same key, only the  last  assignment
        will be functional.

     6. Some keys are only available for enhanced  keyboards.  When  a  non-
        available key is used in a key assignment file, the assignment  will
        be ignored.

     7. A function can be assigned to a single key (or a mouse button) or  a
        primary key combination ([# Shift], [@  Alt],  or  [^ Ctrl] + other
        keys) in the following way:

                    KeyName   Function Name or a macro

          [EXAMPLE]
                    F1        QuickHelp
                    @Y        Paste
                    ^X        Meta
                    #Enter    HardReturn

     8. A function can  be  assigned  to  a  meta  key  combination  in  the
        following way (Note: a meta key should  be  defined  prior  to  meta
        combination.),

                    MetaKey   FunctionName or a macro

          [EXAMPLE]
                    ^X        Meta
                    Meta+^Z   QuitFile
                    Meta+W    Macro EXInput 'B'

16. FONT UTILITIES
==================

When using a Japanese word processor, there is always a time when  you  will
want to create a new character. To meet this need, NJStar provides a set  of
utility programs to add user characters to NJStar's font library files.

UTILITY  JISPRINT.EXE

This utility program prints Japanese characters in a  EUC  file  to  another
file in dot matrix format. You may also  use  this  program  to  output  any
existing characters and modify them into new characters so that they may  be
added to the font files again with JISFONT.EXE.

UTILITY  JISFONT.EXE 

This utility program will update NJStar's font  files  with  user  specified
characters. You can specify the character code  (and  location)  and  bitmap
images in the font file. This program will update  the  user-specified  font
file.

UTILITY   NJ24.EXE

This utility program provides an interactive interface for editing  a  user-
specified 24x24 font library  file.  The  result  takes  effect  immediately
without using JISFONT.EXE and JISPRINT.EXE. Mouse support is available.

These three programs are available for  registered  users  only.  Registered
users please read UTILITY.DOC for more information.

APPENDIX 3

             SUMMARY OF NJSTAR LOCATION-SENSITIVE MOUSE FUNCTIONS


NOTE: This appendix presents a summary of NJStar's  location-sensitive  mouse
function. If the user points  the  mouse  cursor  at  one  of  the  locations
indicated below, and then clicks  the  left  button  once  (or  otherwise  as
described), it will invoke certain functions.

To use a mouse with NJStar, you  have  to  install  a  mouse  driver  program
prior to running NJStar. Please see the mouse  manual  for  more  information
about installing the mouse driver program.

Please look first at the sample screen below. The left side is the ruler  for
Line numbers. Please notice that an EGA monitor has  different  line  numbers
from that of a VGA monitor. The bottom line is the ruler for column  numbers.
Letters (A..H) indicate different areas.
