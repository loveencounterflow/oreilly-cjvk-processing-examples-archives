Public Domain Japanese/English Dictionary file, coordinated by Jim Breen.

CURRENT VERSION
---------------

The version date and sequence number is included in the dictionary itself under
the entry "EDICT". (Actually it is under the JIS-ASCII code "????".  This keeps
it as the first entry when it is sorted.)

The   master   copy   of   EDICT   is   in   the   pub/Nihongo   directory   of
monu6.cc.monash.edu.au.  There are other copies around,  but they may not be as
up-to-date. The easy way to check if the version you have is the latest is from
the size/date.

INTRODUCTION
------------

EDICT is an attempt to produce a public domain Japanese/English  Dictionary  in
machine-readable form.  It was intended initially for use with MOKE (Mark's Own
Kanji Editor) and related software such as JDIC and JREADER, however it has the
potential to be used in a large number of packages. 

At present it is in the "public domain", however at some stage it may be placed
under  Gnu  or  Copyleft  protection,  mainly  to  prevent the work of its many
contributors being exploited by commercial software developers.

FORMAT
------

EDICT is in the "EDICT" format used by MOKE.  It uses EUC coding for  kana  and
kanji,  however  this  can  be  converted  to JIS or SJIS by any of the several
conversion programs around.  It is a text file with one  entry  per  line.  The
format of entries is:

KANJI [KANA] /english_1/english_2/.../

     or

KANA /english_1/.../

The English translations are deliberately brief,  as  the  application  of  the
dictionary is expected to be primarily on-line look-ups, etc.

CONTENTS
--------

EDICT consists of:

(a) the basic EDICT distributed with MOKE 2.0.  This  was  compiled  by  MOKE's
author, Mark Edwards, with assistance from Spencer Green.  Mark has very kindly
released  this  material  to  the public domain as part of EDICTJ.  A number of
corrections have been made to the MOKE original, e.g.  spelling mistakes, minor
mistranslations,  etc.  It  also  had  a  lot of duplications,  which have been
removed.  It contained about 1900 unique entries.  Mark Edwards has also kindly
given permission for the vocabulary files developed for KG (Kanji Guess) to  be
added to EDICT.

(b)  additions  by  Jim Breen.  I laboriously keyed in a ~2000 entry dictionary
used in my first year nihongo course at Swinburne Institute of Technology years
ago (I was given permission by the authors to do this).  I then worked  through
other vocabulary lists trying to make sure major entries were not omitted. This
task is continuing,  although it has slowed down,  and I suspect I will run out
of energy eventually.  Apart from that, I have made a large number of additions
during normal MOKE and JREADER usage (e.g. using it to read fj.* news.)

(c) additions by others.  Many people have contributed entries and  corrections
to EDICT.  I am forever on the lookout for sources of material,  provided it is
genuinely available for use in the Public Domain.  I am especially grateful  to
Theresa  Martin  who  has  been  supplying a lot of useful material,  plus very
perceptive corrections.  Hidekazu Tozaki  has  also  been  a  great  help  with
tidying  up  a  lot  of  awry  entries,  and  helping me identify obscure kanji
compounds.  A full list is at the  back  of  this  file.  A  massive  group  of
contributions came from Sony,  where Rik Smoody had put together a large online
dictionary.

At  this  stage  EDICT is approaching the size of a good commercial dictionary,
which typically has 20,000+ non-name entries with examples,  etc.  It is bigger
than  some  of  the smaller printed dictionaries,  and when used in conjunction
with a search-and-display program like JDIC  or  XJDIC  it  provides  a  highly
effective on-line dictionary service.

COPYRIGHT?
----------

A  word  on copyright.  Of course most of the material in EDICT came from other
published lists.  Dictionary copyright is a difficult  point,  because  clearly
the  first  lexicographer  who  published  "inu  means  dog"  could not claim a
copyright violation over all subsequent Japanese dictionaries.  What makes each
dictionary unique (and copyrightable) is the particular selection of words, the
phrasing of the meanings,  the presentation of the contents (a  very  important
point  in the case of EDICT),  and the means of publication.  The advice I have
received from people who know about these things is that EDICT is just as  much
a  new  dictionary as any others on the market.  Readers may see an entry which
looks familiar,  and say "Aha!  That comes from the XYZ Jiten!".  They  may  be
right,  and they may be wrong.  After all there aren't too many translations of
neko.  Let me make one thing quite clear.  NONE of this  dictionary  came  from
commercial  machine-readable  dictionaries.  I  have  a case of RSI in my right
elbow to prove it.

Please do not contribute  entries  to  EDICT  which  have  come  directly  from
copyrightable sources.  It is hard to check these,  and you may be jeopardizing
EDICT's PD status.

LEXICOGRAPHICAL DETAILS
-----------------------

EDICT is actually a Japanese->English dictionary,  although the words within it
can be selected in either language using appropriate software. (JDIC uses it to
provide both E->J and J->E functionality.)

The early stages of EDICT had size limitations due to its usage (MOKE scans  it
sequentially and JDXGEN, which is JDIC's index generator, held it in RAM.) This
meant  that  examples of usage could not be included,  and inclusion of phrases
was very limited.  JDIC/JDXGEN can now handle a much larger dictionary, but the
compact format has continued.

No  inflections of verbs or adjectives have been included,  except in idiomatic
expressions.  Similarly particles are  handled  as  separate  entries.  Adverbs
formed from adjectives (-ku or ni) are generally not included.  Verbs  are,  of
course, are in the plain or "dictionary" form.

In working on EDICT,  bearing in mind I want to use it in MOKE and with JDIC, I
have had to come up  with  a  solution  to  the  problem  of  adjectival  nouns
[keiyoudoushi]  (e.g.  kirei  and kantan), nouns which can be used adjectivally
with the particle "no" and verbs formed by adding suru (e.g.  benkyousuru).  If
I put entries in edict with the "na" and "suru" included,  MOKE will not find a
match  when  they  are  omitted or,  the case of suru,  inflected.  What I have
decided to do is to put the basic noun into the dictionary and add "(vs)" where
it  can be used to form a verb with suru,  "(a-no)" for common "no" usage,  and
"(an)" if it is an adjectival noun. Entries appear as:

KANJI [benkyou] /study (vs)/
KANJI [kantan] /simple (an)/

Where  necessary,  verbs  are marked with "(vi)" or "(vt)" according to whether
they are intransitive or transitive.  (Work on this aspect  is  continuing.)  I
have  also  used (id) to mark idiomatic expressions,  (col) for colloquialisms,
(pol) for teineigo, etc.

Users intending to make submissions to EDICT should follow the following simple
rules:

o all verbs in plain form.  The English must begin with "to ....".  Add (vi) or
(vt) to the first translation if the nature of the verb is not implicit in  the
translation(s).;

o  add  (an) or (a-no) or (vs) as appropriate to nouns.  Do not put the "na" or
"no" particles on the Japanese, or the "suru" auxilary verb.
                                     
o indicate prefixes and suffixes by "(pref)" and "(suf)" in the  first  English
entry, not by using "-" in the kanji or kana.

o do not add definite or indefinite articles (e.g.  "a",  "an",  "the", etc) to
English nouns unless they are necessary to distinguish the  word  from  another
usage type or homonym.

o do not guess the kanji.

o do not use the "/", "[" or "]" characters except in their separating roles.

o if you are keying from a romaji form, make sure you have the correct kana for
"too/tou" and "zu", where the Hepburn romaji is often ambiguous.

o  do  not use kana or kanji in the "English" fields.  Where it is necessary to
use a Japanese word, e.g. kanto, use romaji.

USAGE
-----

EDICT can be used as the dictionary within MOKE simply by renaming it  "EDICT",
(or  JTOE.DCT  in the new version 2.1 of MOKE.) If you are a MOKE user and have
been adding to your EDICT using the "Ask English?"  option,  you  may  wish  to
append your additions.  Why not send them to me and I will add them to EDICT?

EDICT can be used,  with acknowledgement,  for any purpose whatever, EXCEPT for
inclusion in new commercial products.  Mark Edwards can,  of course,  use it in
later MOKE releases.  Stephen Chung may also be using it in his PD "JWP".

CONTRIBUTIONS
-------------

I will be delighted if people send me corrections, suggestions,  and ESPECIALLY
additions.  Before ripping in with a lot of suggestions, make sure you have the
latest version, as others may have already made the same comments.

The preferred format for submissions is a JIS, EUC or Shift-JIS file (uuencoded
for safety) containing replacement/new entries.  Separate the  amendments  from
the new material: e.g.

**Amendments to EDICT yyyymmmdd Vyy-nnn**

old entry1
new entry1
old entry2
........

**New Entries**

New entry1
New entry2
.........

I prefer not to get a "diff" or "patch" file  as  the  master  EDICT  is  under
continuous  revision,  and  may have had quite a few changes since you got your
copy.
