SORTF Command                                             Version 2.37  Page 1
-------------                                             Sep 20, 1991

Purpose:   The SORTF program reads record data from a file,  sorts the
           records, and writes the data to another file.

Format:
           SORTF [d:][path]fname[.ext] [d:][path]fname[.ext]
                 [/+nnnn[,len]] -or- [/-nnnn,[len]]
                 [/Lnnnn]
                 [/R] [/C] [/Q]
                 [/K] or [/X]

Remarks:   Records are read from the input file,  sorted,  and written
           to the output file.

           Two types of records may be sorted:

           1)  logical  records.   Each  record  ends  with a carriage
|              return and line feed, and  may be up to 8192 characters
               in length.

           2)  fixed length  records.  Each record  is of length  L as
               defined  by  the  '/Lnnnn'  parameter.  The records may
               contain any  kind of  data, including  carriage return,
               line feed, and end-of-file without effecting the record
|              length. The maximum record is 8192 bytes.


           The sort  order is  in ascending  ASCII character sequence.
           You may supply the /R  parameter to reverse the sort  order
           for all fields, or supply /- parameters for each key  field
           to  be  sorted  in  reverse  order.   The  key  fields  are
           processed from  left to  right as  supplied in  the command
           line.

           The /C option may be added to cause SORTF to treat the  key
           fields  as  case  insensitive  data.   That  is, lower case
           letters in the key field are treated as upper case letters.

           You may  supply up  to sixteen  key offsets  and lengths by
           using the /+ or /- parameter, one for each key position and
           its length.   If /+  and /-  are omitted,  the key is taken
           from the first character position for a length of 11.

|          The position 'nnnn' may be a value from one to 8192.

|          The key length 'len' may be  a value from 1 to 8192. The /+
           operand  specifies  that  the  specified  key  is sorted in
           ascending order.  The /- specifies desending sort order for
           that key.

           Use the /Q option to suppress the display of  informational
           messages.  Error messages can not be suppressed.

           /C  specifies  that  the  keys  are  case  insensitive;  if
               supplied, all lower case  characters in the key  fields
               are  converted  to  upper  case  for  the  purposes  of
               sorting.

           /R  sort in  reverse order;  over-rides any  /- options and
               treats them all as /+ options.

           /Q  suppress informational messages.


           /K  creates an output file that consists of sorted key data
               which includes a 5-byte information prefix.

           /X  like /K, except that the 5-byte information prefix is
               omitted, and a cr/lf (carriage return and line feed)
               is added to each record.


           /L  specifies the sorting of fixed length records

           /+  defines the location  and length of  a key field  to be
               sorted in ascending order

           /-  defines the location  and length of  a key field  to be
               sorted in descending order



SORTF Command           INVOKING FROM QUICK BASIC         Version 2.37  Page 3
-------------                                             Sep 20, 1991


        To invoke SORTF from a Quick Basic program, you can use either
        the SHELL or CALL statements.  Use of SHELL is straightforward.

        Use of CALL requires that you include SORTF.OBJ when you LINK
        your QB program.

        You need to make memory available to SORTF from your QB
        program.  For QB version 3 and earlier, you can use the LINK
        '/CP:nnnn' option.  For QB 4 and later, I don't know how you
        release memory.  For BC 7, you can use the SETMEM function.


        In the QB program : CALL SORTF ("test.fil new.fil /+1,12")
                     -or-   SHELL "sortf test.fil new.fil /+1,12"


        For CALL:           LINK qbprogram + SORTF /CP:5000;


        The /CP:5000 option will limit the QB program to 80K plus the
        size of its code, data and stack. Whatever is left can be used
        by CALLed programs. That amount will be about 120K less than
        the DOS available memory.


        For BC 7, here's an example of using SETMEM to release memory:

                M1&=Setmem(0)                   ' Get heap size
                M2&=Setmem(-M1&+128000)         ' Release all but 128k
                Call SORTF (" "+infile$+" "+outfile+" /options")
                M3&=Setmem(M1&)                 ' Re-allocate all to heap


SORTF Command                EXAMPLES                     Version 2.37  Page 4
-------------                                             Sep 20, 1991

         o  to  sort  a  file  in  descending order with the keys in
           position 10:

                SORTF TEST.DAT TEST.SRT /R/+10

         o  to sort the same file using keys with 24 characters:

                SORTF TEST.DAT TEST.SRT /R/+10,24

         o  to sort a file of fixed length, binary records; the input
           file contains records of 18 bytes each,  the  key is  two
           bytes  at  position  17  in  each  record  in  descending
           order, and 11 bytes at postion 1 in ascending order:

                SORTF SRTCATS.RND SRTCATS.IND /L18 /-17,2 /+1,12

         o  to sort on different keys, but creating an an output file
           with the keys only:

                SORTF TEST.DAT TEST.KEYS /-10,2 /+20,4 /-16,3 /K

           Note the use of /-.  It specifies that the first and  third
           keys  are  sorted  in  descending  order, the second key is
           sorted in ascending order.

           The format of the keys-only file using /K is:

           Offset  Length   Contents
           ------  ------   ------------------------------------------
             0       2      Length of data record excluding CR and LF
             2       3      Offset to record in input file
                             +0  hi-byte of 3-byte address offset
                             +1  low word of address offset
             5       n      Variable key data, depends on key definitions

           The format of the keys-only file using /X is:

           Offset  Length   Contents
           ------  ------   ------------------------------------------
             0       n      Variable key data, depends on key definitions
             n       2      Carriage return and line feed

           In the example above, the variable key data format is:

             5       2      Data in records at offset 10
             7       4      Data in records at offset 20
            11       3      Data in records at offset 16
            14       0      End of key record.

           The length of  each keys-only record  is 5 plus  the sum of
           the individual key lengths.  The default, if no /+ or /- is
           specified, is 16 bytes each.

SORTF Command           RESTRICTIONS                      Version 2.37  Page 6
-------------                                             Sep 20, 1991

           Depending on the amount of  memory available,  up to  40000
           records may be sorted.  The maximum file  size that  can be
           sorted depends  on the  maximum number  of records  and the
           average record  length.  For  example,  the  file  size  is
           limited to 3.2 mb for a file consisting of 80-byte records.


           The advantages of using  SORTF  instead of the SORT filter:
                - files larger than 63K may be sorted
                - less time is required
                - sort order can be based on up to 16 fields
                - fixed length files can be sorted

           For  best  results,  place the  input file  on the  fastest
           available drive, e.g. RAM disk.
