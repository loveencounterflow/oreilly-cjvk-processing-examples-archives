************************************************

0. What Is CNPRINT and What's New

CNPRINT, a utility to print Chinese/Japanese/Korean text (or convert to 
	PostScript) under DOS, VMS and UNIX systems.  It works just as 
	a print command on your system.  Currently GB, Hz, zW, BIG5, JIS,
	EUC, Shift-JIS, KSC, UTF8 and UTF7 formats are supported. 

These versions are updated from V2.40/V2.41.  New/improved features are 
indicated by *.  Thanks to users for your valuable support and suggestions.

Main changes:
1. Six positions for page number
2. Allow pipeline-input for unix and DOS (-i option)
3. Support Korean KSC-5601
4. Support more Japanese formats: JIS (old-, new-, nec-), shift-JIS, EUC
5. Auto-detect input codes (either Chinese or Japanese, not both)
6. Better vertical option for Japanese 
7. -f hbfname --> -f=hbfname; 
   -n 0       --> -n=0        
8. Repair functions for GB/Big5/JIS
9. Added control to make the text (e.g. titles) appear at the center
   of a line (@[CB], @[CE])
10. Support European characters generated by NJstar (those characters
    are mapped to 128-160)
11. Now do not break English (ascii) words and numbers like 123.4
12. Draw a line under text (@[UB], @[UE])
13. Specify char size on command line:
	-size=15.4
14. Support unicode (utf8, utf7)  
13. Fixed some bugs.

I. Functions and Features

	1. Print GB/Hz/zW/BIG-5/JIS/KSC/unicode format Chinese/Japanese/Korean 
	   documents (or pure English documents), or convert them to PostScript.

	2. Fast?  It's up to your judgement.  Speed of printing depends on 
	   printers and the number of characters in a page (from 3-4 pages 
	   per minute to 2 minutes per page.  One user reported that it takes 
	   only 135 seconds to print one issue of HXWZ, but on most printers 
	   I tested it takes 6-10 minutes).  

	3. Small disk space requirement; PS file < 400K per issue of HXWZ,
	   (actually ~350K, almost smallest possible).  

    	4. Support HBF (Hanzi Bitmap Format) V1.0, thus can use almost 
	   ALL existing bitmap fonts with different sizes, so don't 
	   worry about disk space if you want to try different softwares.

	5. "Intelligent" treatment of punctuation marks.  Looks nicer.

	6. Multi-column for a page or part of a page.

	7. Change font (both Chinese and English), character size or character
	   width-height ratio, gray level, for a whole document, a group of 
	   characters, or EVEN just one character.

        8. Vertical printing mode (people not from mainland may like it).
        9. Change line space, character space and width of English chars.
       10. Set paper orientation: Portrait or Landscape (use -l option, save
	   paper).
       11. Page numbering, change of paper margins.
       12. Multiple copies of print-out option.
       13. Change English font.
       14. User defined default values for margins, character size, etc.
       15. Start a new page at any point (@[P#]).

    *  17. Generate and import EPS files (picture/graph/text). (see V.10, V.17)
    *  18. Page header, i.e. put something on a specific place on every page.
	   (see V.17)
    *  19. Character or word statistics (enhanced version only, see V.18)
       20. Friendly designed so that even if you make a mistake the program 
	   would take care for you in most cases.

II. What Do You Need to Use CNPRINT
	A machine runing UNIX or VMS (V2.60), or an (IBM compatible) PC 
	    running DOS (V2.61)
	A PostScript printer (CAUTION: NOT ordinary laser printer)
	CNPRINT V?.??
	One or more Chinese (HBF) font file(s) (see part VI)


III. Where to Get CNPRINT
    site: ftp.ifcss.org
    directory: /pub/software/unix/print (cnprint260.readme, cnprint260.tar.gz)
	       /pub/software/vms/print (cnprint260.readme, cnprint260.zip)
	       /pub/software/dos/print (cnprint.doc, cnprint.zip)

Note: 1. The /software directory at ftp.ifcss.org is mirrored at cnd.org 
	(132.249.229.100, directory /pub/software) and nctuccca.edu.tw 
	(140.111.3.21).  As an alternative to ftp.ifcss.org, you may also use
	these two mirror sites for fast access.  
	
      2. The ftp site at neurophys.wisc.edu also carries the above files
	(except fonts and HBF files).  The directory is [public.cn].  This
	site also contains the latest yet not formally released versions
	and some "bug-fix" for unusual systems.  It is a VMS ftp site,
	please use "cd [public.cn]" to change to the directory and transfer
	all files in ASCII mode.  The files there are NOT zipped, but the
	binary files are "uuencoded", so you need to uudecode them.  Please
	read the file "00readme.0", if you have any questions. 
      
      3. Other sites may also carry CNPRINT, but the author will only update
	ftp.ifcss.org and neurophys.wisc.edu with each release.

      4. To unzip (uncompress):

	UNIX:  	tar -zxvf cnprint.260.tar.gz 
			or
		gunzip -c cnprint260.tar.gz | tar -xvf

	VMS:	unzip cnprint260.zip

	DOS: 	pkunzip cnprint.zip

	(tar and gzip utilities are available from 
		ftp://ftp.gnu.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu)
	(If you have problems with decompressing the files, read part 2
	of this section)

	After ungzip or unzip the file "cnprint260.tar.gz" (or
	cnprint260.zip, cnprint.zip), you will get the first 3(4) files 
	depending on your system.  You need to get font files and HBF files 
	seperately (or you can use font and HBF files from other softwares).
	Please read part VI of cnprint.help (DOS: cnprint.hlp) before you get 
	any font or HBF file).
	
	UNIX:   cnprint.help, cnprint.c, cnprint.cmd, cnprint.1, 
		fonts, HBF files
	VMS:    cnprint.help, cnprint.exe, cnprint.cmd, fonts, HBF files
	DOS:    cnprint.hlp, cnprint.exe, cnprint.cmd, fonts, HBF files
      
	
Note To Japanese/Korean Support:
********************************

	I encourage inputs from Japanese/Korean (esp. Korean) users 
	so that I can improve in the next release.

Next release: include true type font support ?
