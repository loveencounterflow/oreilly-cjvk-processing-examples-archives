10. JAPANESE CHARACTER INPUT
============================

This section describes NJStar's  functions  related  to  Japanese  character
input. All functions are listed under the "Input" (∆˛Œœ) menu item.

NJStar supports all 6,879 JIS characters; 6,355 kanji divided in two  levels
(Level 1: 2,965  kanji  arranged  by  pronunciation;  Level 2:  3,390  kanji
arranged by radical), 83  Hiragana,  86  Katakana,  10  numerals,  52  Roman
characters, 147 symbols, 66 Russian characters, 48 Greek characters, and  32
line elements for making charts. NJStar also includes  some  extra  symbols,
which you can extend by adding some custom-made characters.  Run JISFONT.EXE
to add more characters to the standard character set.

FUNCTION  <KanaKanjiInput>   [Alt+F3]     §´§ ¥¡ª˙∆˛Œœ   Kana-Kanji Input

Sets NJStar's input method to Kana-Kanji. When entering KanaKanji mode,  the
left end of the bottom line displays a sign of "KanaKan" (§´§ ¥¡). This is a
phonetic input method based on romaji input method and is  the  new  primary
input method for NJStar, replacing the Romaji input described next. 

Mouse: point the mouse cursor at the left end of the bottom line  and  click
the left button once, to toggle between KanaKanji, Romaji and ASCII mode.

With this input method, alphabetic letters (a-z, A-Z) and the  single  quote
['] and the minus sign [-] are used to input Japanese  phonetic  sound.  All
other ASCII characters may be entered into the editing screen. While all the
numbers are entered in plain ASCII codes,  symbols  such  as  "$, %, \"  are
entered by default in JASCII codes. Please see the function  <ASCinput>  for
details concerning how to enter ASCII and JASCII characters.

(1) Entering Hiragana

Hiragana can be typed directly into editing screen by typing Romaji sound in
lower case letters (a-z).

NJStar  uses  the  following  table  to   translate   romaji   to   Hiragana
automatically as Romaji is being typed in.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                (Note: q - is available in Romaji mode only)

Examples: toyota --> §»§Ë§ø    toukyou --> §»§¶§≠§Á§¶

The romaji-to-kana translation is almost identical to  that  used  in  other
Kanji editors and programs (e.g. MOKE by Mark Edwards, JDIC by  Jim  Breen).
To  enter a small "tsu", you can type a double consonant, e.g. "shippai", or
"t-",  e.g. "shit-pai". To enter  an "n" you  can  type  "n'"  if  necessary
e.g. as in "hon'ya" §€§Û§‰° À‹≤∞°À. Most of the time, just  typing  ordinary
Hepburn or kunrei romaji will work. Note that the  romaji  must  follow  the
kana  style  for long vowels. Tokyo can be "toukyou", but not "tookyoo". For
small a§° e§ß  i§£ o§© u§• tsu§√ wa§Ó ka•ı ke•ˆ ya§„ ye§ß  yo§Á  yu§Â,  type
xa, xe, xi, xo, xu, xtu, xwa, xka, xke, xya, xye, xyo and xyu respectively.

(2) Entering Katakana

To type Katakana characters,  use  the  toggle  switch  [q].  This  switches
between Kana-Kanji  (§´§ ¥¡)  and  Katakana ([•´• ])  modes.  In •´•   mode,
Katakana can be typed in the same way as Hiragana. 

There is yet another way to type Katakana by typing in all upper case letters
(A-Z) in Kana-Kanji  (§´§ ¥¡) mode. But the current version  does  not  allow
vowel sound (AIUEO) under this method, however.

The centered dot for kana separation can be entered as "'ten". 

Example: 

    [•´• ]: Type "jon''ten[SpaceBar][Enter]sumisu" to get •∏•Á•Û°¶•π•ﬂ•π

(3) Entering Kanji

In Kana-Kanji mode to type Kanji, it is necessary  to  indicate  the  point
where Kanji part starts by capitalizing the  first  character  of  Japanese
sound. The system displays Hiragana version  first,  but  everything  typed
will be highlighted. 

As a default, "Automatic Kanji display" <Option> is enabled. In  this  case
all the possible conversion will be displayed in the  bottom  line  of  the
screen as you type along. See the section under <Option> for more details.

Example:                                         ___________________________
    Type "A" will display the following:         §´§ ¥¡: 1 ∞° 2 ∞§ 3 ∞£ 4 ∞¢
                                                 ___________________________
    Typing "Toukyou" will display the following°ß§´§ ¥¡: 1 ≈Ïµ˛ 2 ≈Ï∂µ

    Note: the display of options may differ between Shareware and Registered
          versions.

As long as the entry is displayed in  Hiragana  and  is  still  highlighted,
users can edit the entry by using  [BS]  key. At  this stage, pressing [ESC]
will cancel the whole highlighted input.

Press the corresponding number to get the Kanji you  want.  For  option "1",
users can press [SpaceBar] for  convenience.  If  there  are  more  than  10
matched items, users may use the [>]/[,] or [<]/[.] key to flip through  the
list, and then select an option in the same way. At this stage, the Hiragana
option is replaced by the  Kanji.  Users  may  press  [Esc]  to  revert  the
conversion to Hiragana, if necessary.

Having selected the desired Kanji, users can carry on typing  for  the  next
bits of the sentence. The selection will be cleared automatically as soon as
you go on typing the next section, edit the entry  itself,  or  move  cursor
keys. Alternatively users may press [Enter] to finalize the conversion.

(4) Entering Verbs and Adjectives with a Kanji part

Entering verbs and adjectives is  slightly  different  from  entering  words
that are all Kanji, because their form can vary depending  on  their  tense,
inflection and the degree of politeness. 

The following chart shows the conjugation of the verb π‘§Ø ("iku" = to go)
     °Ω°Ω°Ω°Ω¶·°Ω°Ω°Ω°Ω°Ω°Ω°Ω°Ω°Ω°Ω°Ω°Ω°Ω°Ω°Ω¶·°Ω°Ω°Ω°Ω°Ω°Ω°Ω°Ω°Ω°Ω°Ω°Ω°Ω
             °√  polite  form                °√     plain form           
     °Ω°Ω°Ω°Ω¶‰°Ω°Ω°Ω°Ω°Ω°Ω°Ω°Ω°Ω°Ω°Ω°Ω°Ω°Ω°Ω¶‰°Ω°Ω°Ω°Ω°Ω°Ω°Ω°Ω°Ω°Ω°Ω°Ω°Ω
     present °√ª‰§œ°¢≈Ïµ˛§ÿπ‘§≠§ﬁ§π°£        °√ª‰§œ°¢≈Ïµ˛§ÿπ‘§Ø°£        
     pres.neg°√ª‰§œ°¢≈Ïµ˛§ÿπ‘§≠§ﬁ§ª§Û°£      °√ª‰§œ°¢≈Ïµ˛§ÿπ‘§´§ §§°£    
     past    °√ª‰§œ°¢≈Ïµ˛§ÿπ‘§≠§ﬁ§∑§ø°£      °√ª‰§œ°¢≈Ïµ˛§ÿπ‘§√§ø°£      
     past,neg°√ª‰§œ°¢≈Ïµ˛§ÿπ‘§≠§ﬁ§ª§Û§«§∑§ø°£°√ª‰§œ°¢≈Ïµ˛§ÿπ‘§´§ §´§√§ø°£
     °Ω°Ω°Ω°Ω¶„°Ω°Ω°Ω°Ω°Ω°Ω°Ω°Ω°Ω°Ω°Ω°Ω°Ω°Ω°Ω¶„°Ω°Ω°Ω°Ω°Ω°Ω°Ω°Ω°Ω°Ω°Ω°Ω°Ω

NJStar's dictionary stores this verb as π‘k (§§k) and  π‘t (§§t)  and  users
need to indicate where the §“§È§¨§  part begins by  capitalizing  the  first
character of the sound. Thus in  the  above  example,  verbs  are  typed  as
follows:

                IKimasu                 IKu
                IKimasen                IKanai
                IKimashita              ITta
                IKimasendeshita         IKanakatta

Since   this   method   of   conversion   does   not   require   grammatical
interpretation, the system responds quicker. In addition, users can  convert
various styles of Japanese,  such  as  ancient ° ∏≈∏Ï°À,  literary °  ∏∏Ï°À,
colloquial° ∏˝∏Ï°À, and dialect°  ˝∏¿°À.

(5) Katakana Version of English words

The Katakana Version of some English words can  be  entered  in  the  Romaji
input mode. The user must enter a single quote ['] or lower case [l] (el for
latin) before the English word. The availability of a word  depends  on  the
entries in KANJI.DIC.

Example:   Typing  'computer       will give     •≥•Û•‘•Â°º•ø
                   'editor                       •®•«•£•ø
                   'communication                •≥•ﬂ•Â•À•±°º•∑•Á•Û

The system first searches for the matching index entry in the Glossary  then
KANJI.DIC. When no word is found in neither of them, the ASCII entry remains
as it is in the document.

Note: Pressing upper case [L] (el) switches input mode to ASCII (=[Alt+F6]).

(6) Kana/English to Kanji lookup

    See <EDicLookup> [Alt+X]/[Alt+E] for more details.

(7) Entering Punctuations

In Kana-Kanji input mode, all punctuation characters on the keyboard can  be
entered. When there is no  Kanji  displayed  for  selection,  the  following
symbols can be entered directly:

  Typed as:  ~ ` ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) _ = + \ | [ ] { } ; : " " < > , . ? /
  Appear as: °¡°§°™°˜°Ù°°Û°Ô°ı°ˆ° °À°≤°·°‹°¿°√°ÿ°Ÿ°⁄°€°®°ß°÷°◊°‘°’°¢°£°©°ø

When there are Kanji characters displayed in the bottom line waiting  to  be
selected, keys that are used for selecting  Kanji,  i.e., [>], [,], [<], [.]
will not  produce  punctuation  characters  but  performs  their  designated
function described under (3) "Entering Kanji" above.

(8) A complete sentence:

               Ashita, watashi wa toukyou ni ikimasu.
               §¢§∑§ø°¢§Ô§ø§∑§œ≈Ïµ˛§Àπ‘§≠§ﬁ§π°£
  is typed as: ashita,watashihaToukyou[SpaceBar]niIKimasu.

Note that it is standard convention to type particles §œ wa, §ÿ e,  and §Ú o
as "ha", "he", and "wo" respectively.

(9) Using the Glossary

  See <Glossary> [Ctrl+G] for more details.

FUNCTION  <RomajiInput>   [Alt+F5]         •Ì°º•ﬁª˙∆˛Œœ   Romaji Input

Sets NJStar's input method to Romaji. When entering Romaji  mode,  the  left
hand side of the bottom line displays a sign of "Romaji" (•Ì°º•ﬁª˙). 

Mouse: point the mouse cursor at the left end of the  bottom line and  click
the left button once, to toggle between KanaKanji, Romaji and ASCII mode.

The use of keyboard to input Japanese is basically identical with Kana-Kanji
input described above. The main differences between Kana- Kanji  and  Romaji
are:

  a) Everything typed will be first displayed in the bottom line, and  users
     need to select each time the desired characters / words.
  b) When no Kanji options  are  displayed  in  the  bottom  line,  pressing
     uppercase alphabetic letters (A-Z) will enter ASCII characters directly
     into the editing screen.
  c) Glossary is not available from this  input  method, but  instead  EDICT
     is available.

(1) Entering Hiragana

You can enter as  few  as  one  romanized  Hiragana,  or  a  whole  line  of
romanized Hiragana.

Example:
    ___________________________________________________________________
    Romaji: shippai    1 §∑§√§—§§ 2 º∫«‘
    ___________________________________________________________________
    Romaji: watashiha  1 §Ô§ø§∑§œ 
    ___________________________________________________________________
    Romaji: motte      1 §‚§√§∆ 

Hiragana is usually displayed as choice #1 for selection.  Pressing  [1]  or
[SpaceBar] to select it. Pressing [ESC] at any time will  clear  the  romaji
input line.

The centered dot for kana separation can be entered as the single quote ',
    ___________________________________________________________________
    Romaji: a'a    1 §¢°¶§¢


(2) Entering Katakana

Normally, when romaji is entered, NJStar translates it into  Hiragana,  then
searches the 'KANJI.DIC' for the possible matches of the  Hiragana  entered.
If no matches are found, NJStar will display the  Katakana  version  of  the
romaji as choice #2. Pressing [2] will select the Katakana string. If one or
more matches are found, NJStar will display  the  matched  Kanji's  together
with the Hiragana string. If the user wants to  enter  Katakana  instead  of
Hiragana or Kanji, pressing [ALT+1]  will  select  it.  Pressing [ESC]  will
cancel the entire input line.

Example:
    ______________________________________________________________________
    Romaji: o-sutoraria  1 §™°º§π§»§È§Í§¢ 2 •™°º•π•»•È•Í•¢

(3) Entering Kanji

When a correct Romaji code is entered, its Hiragana version is displayed  at
the bottom line. If the displayed Hiragana matches a kana-to-kanji entry  in
KANJI.DIC, the matched Kanji entries are also listed for selection.

Example:
    ______________________________________________________________________
    Romaji: ai   >  1 §¢§§ 2 πÁ 3 ¡Í 4 ∞¶ 5 ∞°∞· 6 ∞• 7 Õı 8 ∞ß 9 €£ 0 ∞®
    ______________________________________________________________________
    Romaji: toukyou 1 §»§¶§≠§Á§¶ 2 ≈Ïµ˛
    ______________________________________________________________________
    Romaji: oosaka  1 §™§™§µ§´   2 ¬Á∫Â

Press the corresponding number to select Kanji. Press [ESC]  to  cancel  the
entire input line. The convention for the selection is identical  with  that
of Kana-Kanji input.

The rules for entering verbs and adjectives  are  basically  identical  with
Kana-Kanji input.

(5) Typing English word to get Japanese

As in Kana-Kanji mode, users can input an English word  to  get  a  Japanese
word starting with ['] key. But instead of  having  Glossary,  Romaji  input
integrates the function of <English> [Alt+F7] described below.

When invoking this function, the system  first  searches  for  the  matching
entry in KANJI.DIC to get Katakana version of  English  words.  If  this  is
unsuccessful, the system then calls EDICT to find the matching entries.  See
<EDicLookup> for more details.

If no match is found at this stage, the system displays  an  error  message.
User can edit the input line and try again, or press [ESC]  to  cancel  the
whole input line.

(6) Entering Punctuation

In Romaji input mode, when there is nothing in the bottom line (press [ESC]
to clear the input line if there are Kana/Kanji waiting  to  be  selected),
all the following punctuation characters on the keyboard can be entered.

  Typed as:  ~ ` ! @ # $ % & * ( ) _ = + \ | [ ] { } ; : " " < > , . ? /
  Appear as: °¡°§°™°˜°Ù°°Û°ı°ˆ° °À°≤°·°‹°¿°√°ÿ°Ÿ°⁄°€°®°ß°÷°◊°‘°’°¢°£°©°ø

(7) A complete sentence:

  §¢§∑§ø°¢§Ô§ø§∑§œ≈Ïµ˛§Àπ‘§≠§ﬁ§π°£(Ashita, watashi wa toukyou ni ikimasu)
  is typed as: ashita1,watashi1ha1toukyou2ni1iKimasu1.

    ___________________________________________________________________
    Romaji: ashita      1 §¢§∑§ø 2 Ã¿∆¸ 
    ___________________________________________________________________
    Romaji: watashi     1 §Ô§ø§∑ 2 ª‰
    ___________________________________________________________________
    Romaji: ha          1 §œ
    ___________________________________________________________________
    Romaji: toukyou     1 §»§¶§≠§Á§¶ 2 ≈Ïµ˛ 3 ≈Ï∂µ
    ___________________________________________________________________
    Romaji: ni          1 §À
    ___________________________________________________________________
    Romaji: iKimasu     1 π‘§≠§ﬁ§π 2 ¿∏§≠§ﬁ§π 3 ≥Ë§≠§ﬁ§π 4 ¿¬§≠§ﬁ§π

(8) Entering JIS Characters by typing two typable ASCII character

In Romaji input mode, if the first character is '^', NJStar  will  interpret
the rest of the input as 2 bytes of JIS code each by masking  the  high  bit
on. In some email systems or news systems, the high bit is masked off. Using
this method, you can reconstruct the actual message from the high-bit-masked
ASCII character. For example, a Japanese email, saying: "my name is [Pd9cGH]"
can be read by typing the characters inside the "[]" pair prefixed by a '^'.

   ___________________________________________________________________
   Romaji: ^Pd9cGH  1 –‰π„«»

FUNCTION  <English>     [Alt+F7]      ±—œ¬∆˛Œœ        English Input

Sets input method 'English to Japanese'. Type an English  word,  then  press
[SpaceBar] will force NJStar to search  the  word  in  the  EDICT,  Japanese
English dictionary.

FUNCTION   <Option>     [Ctrl+F2]       •™•◊•∑•Á•Û      Option

The following option changes the behaviour of Kana-Kanji mode:

    DelayConvert: Toggles the 'Delay Conversion' mode. 
                  In Kana-Kanji input, when Delay Conversion is set ON, 
                  NJStar does not display Kanji until [SpaceBar] is pressed.

In this case, the first item of the selection list is automatically selected,
and the rest of list are displayed on the Bottom line.  

Beginning from NJStar v3.0, all the  option  changes  and  changes  made  by
Toggle  functions  (such  as  Input  Method,  JASCII  mode,  etc.)  will  be
automatically saved on exit, and restored in  the  next  session  of NJStar.

FUNCTION   <Radicals>      [Shift+F1]       …ÙºÛ∏°∫˜          Radicals

This function is seldom used as an input method.  However,  it  provides  an
handy way to look up a character by radicals, especially when  the  user  is
not very sure about its pronunciation.

When starting this function, a pop-up window will display all  214  radicals
arranged by the number of strokes.  Use  the  cursor  or  mouse  to select a
radical. Once selected, another  window  will  be  displayed  with  all  the
characters for that radical arranged again by number  of  strokes.  Use  the
down or right arrow key to scroll through the list. Once the  character  you
are looking for has been found, it can be pasted into the editing screen  by
pressing [Return]. Press [F1] key to get coding and  other  information  for
the character. (See function <KanjiInfo> below.)

FUNCTION   <EUCinput>       [Alt+F4]         EUC•≥°º•…∆˛Œœ      EUC/Kuten

Sets NJStar's input method to EUC or Kuten code  input  modes.  In  previous
versions, there used to be two separate functions but beginning with Version
3.0, they  have  been  merged  into  one  command.  However,  when  invoking
<EUCinput>, the left end of the bottom  line  will  display  a  "EUC"  sign,
unless a Kuten code is detected by the system, and then it will display  the
"Kuten" (∂Ë≈¿) sign. (A EUC code starts with [a] to [f] while a  Kuten  code
starts with [0] to [9].)

EUC and Kuten are major supplementary input  methods  in  NJStar.  The  file
EUC.DOC lists out all valid EUC  codes  and  the  corresponding  characters,
while KUTEN.DOC does for Kuten codes.

To enter a EUC code, you have to complete all four code letters before it is
displayed on the editing screen. For Kuten codes, the first two code numbers
bring up a list of  characters.  Select  a  character  from  the  list  with
[Alt]+number key or a number key on the keypad,  or  wait  until  all  four-
number codes have been entered.

EUC Example:   d0e4 -> –‰  b9e3 -> π„  c7c8 -> «»

Kuten Example: 4868 -> –‰  2567 -> π„  3940 -> «»

FUNCTION   <AscInput>      [Alt+F6]         ±—ª˙∆˛Œœ      Ascii Input

Sets NJStar's input method to ASCII. When using ASCII, the left end  of  the
bottom line will display an "ASCII" sign. The  filename,  size,  and  cursor
position are displayed on the bottom line. The "*" sign in front of  "Bytes"
indicates the current file has been modified since it was  opened  or  since
the last time it was saved.

Mouse: point the mouse cursor at the left side of the bottom line and  click
the left button once, to toggle  between  KanaKanji, Romaji and ASCII  input
modes.

ASCII mode is used to enter all English characters, plus the extended  ASCII
character set (128-160). To enter those  characters,  press  [Alt]  together
with the corresponding ASCII code with the numerical keys from  the  keypad.
For instance, to enter [Å], hold down [Alt] and type [1], [2],  [9]  on  the
numeric keypad. Release the [Alt] key and the character will be pasted  into
the editing screen.

FUNCTION   <EXInput>       [Alt+F2]         ¬æ§Œ∆˛ŒœÀ°        Extra Input

Lets user select one of the following input methods as listed on the  bottom
line:

  b. bushu        Coded with number 0-9 for Radical number (total 214)
     …ÙºÛ         Use standard letter keys to enter code.

  c. 4corner      Coded with number 0-9 for a classification of four
     ªÕ≥—         corners. Maximum length of codes is 4 numbers.  
                  Use standard letter keys to enter code.

  n. Nelson#      Coded with number 0-9 for number in Nelson Dictionary
     •Õ•Î•Ω•Û     Use standard letter keys to enter code.

  s. Strokes      Coded with number 0-9 for total stroke count.
     ≤ËøÙ

  u. UniCode      Coded with Hex numbers for Unicode.
     •Ê•À•≥°º•…

All these input methods have their strengths and weaknesses. Some users  are
familiar with one or the other.

All unused letters listed above, such as a, d, e ..., may  be  used  for  an
user-defined input method [NJINPUT?.DIC]. The user can also  substitute  the
existing input dictionary file  with  a  user-defined  input  dictionary  to
include one or more of the unused letters.

One of NJStar's outstanding features is to allow users  to  implement  their
own preferred input methods by setting up an input dictionary  with  NJStar.
Once the dictionary,  a  EUC  file,  is  coded,  NJStar's  utility  program,
NJJDIC.EXE, can convert it into NJStar's input dictionary. This adds  a  new
input method to NJStar. For more details, see NJJDIC.DOC.

FUNCTION   <Symbols>       [Ctrl+6]         ∆√ºÏ§ µ≠πÊ        Symbols

This function is also seldom used as an input method. However,  it  provides
an handy way to look up a special symbol character in a pop-up window.

When invoking this function, a window will pop-up, showing all  the  symbols
in the EUC character set. Use the cursor or mouse to select a symbol. If the
screen is full, use the down or right arrow key to scroll through the  list.
When the character is  found, it  can  be  pasted  into  editing  screen  by
pressing [Return].

FUNCTION   <Convert2Kanji>   [Alt+F1]        —¥π°ß§¢¢™∞°       Convert

In Kana-Kanji mode, converts the marked Hiragana string into  Kanji.  If  no
matching options are found in KANJI.DIC, the system enters the Glossary mode,
asking the user to register the new entry. See <Glossary> for more details.

You can use the [SpaceBar] to invoke this function.

FUNCTION   <UndoConvert>   [Shift+F8]        —¥π§Œ≤Û…¸         Undo Convert

Reverts the conversion just performed from Hiragana to Kanji  in  Kana-Kanji
mode  while  the  word  is  still  highlighted. This  function  works   only
immediately after a Hiragana string has been converted to Kanji and no block
operation is performed.

By performing  this  function  twice  consecutively,  you  can  restore  the
original state before conversion.

(1) If the highlighted Japanese words are originally  typed  in,  the  input
    itself will be cancelled. (i.e., delete the highlighted region).

(2) If the highlighted Japanese words are marked region, the  marked  region
    will not be removed but simply the region will be unmarked.

You can use the [ESC] / [INS] / [Insert] key to access this function  as  an
one-key operation.

FUNCTION   <JasciiMode>   [Alt+F9]         ¡¥≥—•‚°º•…      Full size English

Toggles NJStar's JASCII and Non-JASCII input modes. In JASCII mode,  a  sign
of "zenkaku" (¡¥≥—) will be displayed at the right bottom corner.

The initial mode can be set with NJCONFIG.EXE.

There is no differences in Japanese  characters  input  under  either  mode.
ASCII characters, in JASCII mode,  are  mapped  into  JIS counterparts.  For
instance, an ASCII period, a dot, is mapped to a  Japanese  period, a  small
circle. Some ASCII characters may be mapped into different presentations  in
JASCII mode. For example, a caret [^]  is  mapped  to  a  Japanese  currency
symbol °Ô. However, this function only affects input  of  ASCII  characters.
The mappings are as follows:

  A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
 £¡£¬£√£ƒ£≈£∆£«£»£…£ £À£Ã£Õ£Œ£œ£–£—£“£”£‘£’£÷£◊£ÿ£Ÿ£⁄

Mouse: point the mouse cursor to the right end of the bottom line and  click
the left button once to invoke this function.

11. TOOLS
=========

This section describes NJStar's several enhancements  listed  under  "Tools"
(•ƒ°º•Î) in the main menu. There are three kinds of enhancements mentioned
in this section. (1) Dictionary-related, (2) System Configuration,  and  (3)
Macro commands. Macro commands are described in the next section.

FUNCTION   <EDicLookup> [Alt+E]/[Alt+X]     º≠ΩÒ§Œ∏°∫˜       EDIC Lookup

Displays a translation window for the current character or  word  in  either
Japanese or English.

Before  calling  this  function,  position  the  cursor  under  the  desired
character or mark the word as a block.

When the function is called, the system will search for matching  characters
or words in the dictionary and display the result in the pop-up  window.  If
the content of dictionary exceeds one screen,  press  [Down]  arrow  key  or
[PgDn] key to scroll through the list of entries.

If the current character is Japanese and is not "marked",  NJStar  treats it
as a single character, and will intelligently search all the  words  in  the
dictionary which match the words around the  cursor  character.  If  only  a
portion of a Japanese word is marked, NJStar will  search  all  the  entries
that contain this character or word. If no match is found in the dictionary,
NJStar will indicate so. Custom-made  characters  cannot  be  found  in  the
dictionary.

If the current word is English and is not "marked", the search will  operate
on the whole word.  If  only  a portion of a word is marked, only the marked
segment will be processed.  If the marked block contains more than one word,
only the first word will be searched.

If the system finds the entry  in  the  dictionary,  it  then  displays  all
entries in which the word is found. Once the desired entry is located by the
user, press [Enter] to insert the Japanese word into the editing screen,  or
[SpaceBar] to dump the whole entry into the screen.

In both Kana-Kanji and Romaji modes, if there are some Kanji  characters  or
words on the bottom line, user can press  [F1]  to  get  their  meanings  in
English.

From Romaji input mode, typing an English words (preceded by [']) and  press
[SpaceBar] looks up the meaning of the word in  Japanese-English  dictionary
when no Katakana version is found in KANJI.DIC.

FUNCTION   <Glossary>      [Ctrl+G]         Õ—∏ÏΩ∏         Glossary

Brings up the user definable vocabulary bank.  These  glossary  entries  are
accessible from Kana-Kanji mode directly. When you enter a code matching the
index string, NJStar will convert the code into the pre-defined string.

The Glossary is basically used for two  purposes: 1)  supplement  KANJI.DIC;
2) store frequently used long words / phrases which are made  accessible  by
short-hand keys.

(1) Supplement KANJI.DIC

In Kana-Kanji mode, users can register  a  new  word  in  Glossary  when  an
expected Kanji option does not appear as one of displayed options.  If there
is no  option  displayed in the bottom line, the system automatically enters
in the Glossary mode as soon as users press [SpaceBar].

(2) Store frequently used long words and phrases

The Glossary function allows users to identify a string  with  any  letters,
not just valid Romaji or English. If an entry is not a valid romaji code, it
must start with ['] key. For instance, 'OZ --> πÎΩ£, 'PRC --> √Ê≤⁄øÕÃ±∂¶œ¬πÒ,
'njstar --> °ÿ∆Ó∂À¿±°Ÿ. Furthermore, you can also define  a  non-JIS  string,
such as 'fyi --> FOR YOUR INFORMATION. This  is  quite  different  from  the
user-Definable input method (as with the one generated by NJJDIC.EXE)  where
the primary advantage of Kana-Kanji input cannot be obtained. On  the  other
hand, a user vocabulary defined  through  such  a  user  dictionary  is  not
accessible in Kana-Kanji mode.

NJStar will search the glossary  dictionary  first  and  then  the  ordinary
Kanji dictionary. Numbers  can  be  used  in  the index code, but not as the
first letter. Note that the index entry is case sensitive, so the index word
"OZ" is not obtainable by typing "'oz" but "'OZ".

The Glossary list may be updated  manually.  When  the  Glossary  window  is
displayed, you can use [F1] for 'Add New', [F2] for 'Add Marked' Block, [F3]
for 'Edit Current', [F4] for 'Delete Current', [ESC]  to  quit.  Pressing  a
letter 'a-z' will search for  an  entry  starting  with  the  key.  Pressing
[SpaceBar] to insert the current entry into the current file.

While the Glossary list displays only  one  line  for  each  entry,  it  can
actually contain a much larger content. Mark a portion of  the  screen  with
the <Block> function, then add the block after the Glossary list  is  called
up by the <Glossary> function. If the marked block is less  then  one  line,
you can edit the block. Otherwise, the large block cannot be edited further.
The only way to work around this is to insert the  block  into  the  editing
screen and edit it, then add the block to the Glossary as a  new  entry  and
delete the old one.

FUNCTION   <KanjiInfo>     [Alt+Z]          ¥¡ª˙§Œæ Û      Kanji Info

Displays the current character in large size in a  pop-up  window,  together
with  meanings, readings, grading as well as coding information, such as EUC,
UniCode, Radical, Strokes, etc.

Mouse: double click the left mouse button on the  character  to call up this
function.

FUNCTION   <NJConfig>       [Ctrl+C]         •ª•√•∆•£•Û•∞     NJCONFIG

Starts NJCONFIG.EXE program inside of the NJStar system. User may change the
system setup through NJCONFIG.EXE. (See  section  System  Configuration  for
more details.)

Most setup changes made through this function will take effect  immediately,
such as printer drivers and printing setup. However, the video card settings
will not take place until the user starts NJStar again.

=============================================================================

12. MACROS COMMANDS
===================

This section describes NJStar's Macro related functions. Those functions are
located  under "Tools"  (•ƒ°º•Î)  in  the  main  menu.  This  section   also
describes the way to compose the macro  text  file  and  use  NJMAC.EXE  for
compiling NJStar macros.

A macro is a pre-defined sequence of a series of NJStar  commands.  You  can
record a series of commands within NJStar, or write a macro text  file  with
NJStar and then compile it with NJStar's utility  program,  NJMAC.EXE.  This
will convert it to a macro file that can be loaded into NJStar.

See PROGRAM USAGE for information about loading a macro in the command  line
with '-L' and '-X' options.

FUNCTION   <MacroRec>      [F11]            •ﬁ•Ø•Ìµ≠œø          Macro Rec

Starts and stops macro recording. When entering  macro-recording  mode,  the
right side of the bottom will display a sign of "Record."

Mouse: point the mouse cursor at "Record" and then  click  the  left  button
once to invoke this function.

When starting, a sequence of NJStar commands entered by  the  user  will  be
recorded and stored in the macro  buffer,  until  this  command  is  invoked
again. The contents of the macro buffer will be cleared by  the  next  macro
recording operation.

When recording a macro, pressing [ESC] would be considered to  be  a  normal
command to be recorded, instead of cancellation of the command.

Beginning from NJStar v3.0, contents in  the  macro  buffer  will  be  saved
automatically on exit, so that the macro  can  be  executed  the  next  time
NJStar is run.

FUNCTION   <MacroExec>     [F12]            •ﬁ•Ø•Ìº¬π‘      Macro Exec

Executes the macro stored in the macro buffer. If the macro buffer is empty,
it will do nothing.

If a macro turns out to contain an infinite loop, you must press [Ctrl+C] or
[Ctrl+Break] to cancel the execution.

FUNCTION   <SaveMacro>     [Alt+F11]        •ﬁ•Ø•Ì ›¥…       Save Macro

Saves the contents of the macro buffer to a file with a user-specified  file
name. Thus, a recorded macro can be repeatedly used. The macro filename  has
the standard extension, ".NJM". Any other extension given to the file by the
user will be ignored.

If you enter a filename that already exists on disk,  the  system  will  ask
for confirmation. Press [ESC] at any time to cancel the request.

FUNCTION   <ReadMacro>     [Alt+F12]        •ﬁ•Ø•Ì∆…Ω–§∑     Read Macro

Reads a user-specified macro file into the macro buffer, so that  the  macro
can be executed. When NJStar prompts for a filename, don't use an extension
as NJM will be used as the default.

FUNCTION   <RepeatCmd>     [Ctrl+F11]       (•Í•‘°º•»        Repeat Command)

Repeats a previous command a given  number  of  times.  If  it  is  a  macro
command, <RepeatCmd> will repeat the macro for a given number of times. This
function can not be used inside a macro.

MACRO TEXT FILES

User may also build macro files from scratch. To  create  your  own  macros,
write them as text files. The following basic rules apply to macro files:

     1.  A macro  text  file  should  be  given  the  ".NJ"  extension;  The
         converted NJStar macro file has the standard extension of ".NJM".

     2.  A macro text file may contain one macro statement only,  which  can
         contain one or more commands;

     3.  A macro statement should always start with a string "Macro";

     4.  When a line gets too long, split the line and use "&" at the end of
         line to indicate that it continues on the next line;

     5.  A  comment  line  in  the  macro  text  file  starts  with  an  "*"
         character;

     6.  All commands listed in this manual can be  written  to  macro  text
         files, separated by a space. Commands are case insensitive;

     7.  Use double quotation marks ("") around text or search strings;

     8.  Use single quotation marks ('') to input the enclosed text  to  the
         editing screen or a Japanese character code at prompt;

     9.  Use #nnn to input an ASCII character represented by nnn. The number
         nnn can be either in Decimal, Hex, or Oct format;

     10. Use $nn to pause the execution for a period of nn ticks.  One  tick
         is equal to 1/18 second. User input  will  be  ignored  during  the
         pause;

     11. Use the <Pause> command to pause the execution of  the  macro  when
         NJStar prompts user to enter  a  string,  until  the  user  presses
         [Return] or [ESC]. Other editing  tasks  can  be  done  during  the
         pause. <Pause> can be also used when  the  <DOS>  command  returns.
         NJStar will wait for a key press before  clearing  the  DOS  output
         screen;

     12. Use <ScreenOff> to freeze the screen  display  when  the  macro  is
         being executed. Use <ScreenOn> to turn on the screen. In  any  case
         NJStar  will turn on the  screen  display  at  the  end  of  macro.
         <ScreenOff> will speed up the macro execution speed;

     13. Use string plus ":" to compose  a  label.  A  macro  statement  can
         contain up to 64 labels. Label example, BEGIN: LOOP: ;

     14. Use <Jump> followed  by  a  label  to  indicate  the  unconditional
         command switch to the label within the macro statement;

     15. Use <JTrue> followed by a label to indicate the command  switch  to
         the label within the macro statement when the previous  command  is
         successfully executed or the condition checked is true  (e.g.,  the
         current  character   is   a  Japanese   character   when   executed
         <IsJapanese>); and

     16. Use <JFalse> followed by a label to indicate the command switch  to
         the label within the macro statement when the previous command  can
         not be executed or the condition checked is false.

Here are some more commands for use in the macro:

         <SoundOff>        - Turn Error Beep Off.
         <SoundOn>         - Turn Error Beep On.
         <IsJapanese>      - If the current character is a Japanese (15-84).
         <IsTwoBytes>      - if the current character is a Two Bytes EUC                                     character.
         <IsCursorInBlock> - The cursor is inside a marked block.

Here is an example of a macro statement, This macro will replace  one JASCII
characters "°Ù" (JASCII  '#' characters)  with  two  ASCII '#' characters.

     [EXAMPLE]

         Macro BegFile ASCinput Replace "°Ù" Enter "##" Enter

You can define a macro command  in  NJCONFIG.KEY,  and  assign  the  command
permanently to a Key. For example, the following syntax  assigns  the  macro
shown above to the 'Ctrl+X+1' key:

Meta+1  Macro BegFile ASCinput Replace "°Ù" Enter "##" Enter

UTILITY   NJMAC.EXE

The utility program NJMAC.EXE  is  in  the  NJStar  sub-directory.  It  will
convert a macro text file into a compiled file so that it  can  be  executed
within NJStar.

     [USAGE] C:\NJJ30> NJMAC macfile

Macfile is the name of a macro text file. Add the drive name  and  the  full
path if necessary. The resultant macro file will use  the  same  file  name,
with an extension name of .NJM. The location of the resultant macro file  is
the same as that of the original macro text file.

If the macro text file contains an invalid statement, NJMAC will generate an
error message indicating the error location within the macro text file.

A compiled macro file can be loaded with NJStar as  a  command  line  switch
when the system is started. See Section <<Program Usage>> for more details.


EXAMPLES OF USEFUL MACRO COMMANDS

NJStar has more than 120 functions/commands in total. Each command  performs
certain pre-defined tasks. However, there are always  tasks  that  a  single
command cannot do. With NJStar's macros, you  can  create  new  commands  by
combining several single commands into a macro command. What a macro command
can do is only limited by your imagination. Here are some examples  (already
defined in NJCONFIG.KEY).

*(1) Mark a sentence with Kanji character only.
Meta+1 Macro ScreenOff UnMarkBlock IsJapanese JFalse END:           &
       LEFT: IsJapanese JFalse BEG: CursorLeft Jump LEFT:           &

13. PRINTING
============

This section describes NJStar's printing function,  located  under  "Output"
(Ω–Œœ) in the main menu. This section  also  describes  printing  format
commands and the utility file NJPRN.EXE.

FUNCTION   <Print>       [Ctrl+P]          ∞ı∫˛          Print File

Prints the current file to a user-defined output device.

Currently, NJStar supports 9 pin or 24 pin dot  matrix  printers  (Epson  or
IBM-ProPrinter and compatibles), Canon BubbleJet printers, and HP DeskJet or
LaserJet  printers  (and  their  emulations).  You  have  to   install   the
appropriate printer driver for your chosen printer with NJCONFIG.EXE.

After the correct printer driver is installed, you  can  print  the  current
file to the printer or to a file. Generally, NJStar uses 16x16  font  for  9
pin  dot  matrix  printers,  and  better  fonts  for  printers  with  higher
resolution capabilities. The user has no control on the type of font.

If the printer is not connected, or if you  want  to  use  another  printer,
print the current file to a file, with  the  appropriate  printer  settings.
NJStar's utility program, NJPRN.EXE, can be used later  to  print  out  that
file to the printer.

UTILITY  NJPRN.EXE

PRINTING FORMAT COMMANDS

The following are NJStar's printing format commands, to enhance  the  output
format.

   \NewPage             Forces to print on a new page from here

   \PageNumber(nn)      Changes the  current page  number to nn, whatever it
                        was originally set

   \NumberStyle("%d")   Specifies the page number style as text shown in "". 
                        Variable %d is the current page number.

   \TopMargin(nn)       Sets the top margin to nn lines
                        (1 line=1/6 in. or 1 line=30 dots)

   \BottomMargin(nn)    Sets the bottom margin to nn lines
                        (1 line=1/6 in. or 1 line=30 dots)

   \LineSpace(nn)       Sets the space between lines to nn dots

   \Font(nn)            Sets the size of Japanese character to nn.
                        ( 1 normal; 2 larger)

   \Center              Centers the current line on page

   \Bold                Force NJStar to print in Bold, Mincho style 
                        font (JIS.24 )

   \Thin                Force NJStar to print in thin, Gothic style 
                        font (JIST.24)

   ===================  =====================================================

Here are some examples of how to use printing format commands  in  the  text
file.

        [EXAMPLE]        \NewPage

Forces the printer to perform a form feed and then prints the following text
on a new sheet.

        [EXAMPLE]        \PageNumber(2) \NumberStyle("•⁄°º•∏%d")

Forces the system to set the page numbers to start from  2  from  here.  The
page number printed on this sheet would look like "•⁄°º•∏2".

        [EXAMPLE]        \LeftMargin(5) \RightMargine(5) \LineSpace(5)

Forces the system to change both margins to 5 characters from here onwards,
and use new space setting. Normally, it would be advisable to set LineSpace
with a  smaller  value  when  drawing  a  table  with  NJStar's  line  draw
characters, such as ¶⁄,¶€,¶‹,¶›,¶ﬂ ,¶ﬁ,  etc.  Don't  forget  to  set  line
spacing back to normal when finished.

        [EXAMPLE]        \Center ƒ´∆¸ø∑ π

Forces the system to print the string "ƒ´∆¸ø∑ π" at the center of the line.

        [EXAMPLE]        \Font(2) \Center ∆¸À‹§Œ¿Øº£≤»
                         \Font(1)

Forces the system to print "∆¸À‹§Œ¿Øº£≤»" in an larger size at the center of
the line, and then return to normal size to print the next line.

Here are two more points for using print format commands.

     1) All commands must start with "\" at the very beginning of the  Line,
        To print a "\" character at the beginning of a line, use "\\".

     2) More than one command can be written on a single line.

Finally, there is one special print format command that does not start  with
a [\]. This is [~], which forces the system to print the next  character  in
"reverse" style character, that is, Thin instead of Bold.

Occasionally, the user might  want  to  print  some  characters  in  reverse
font. For example, while the current file uses Thin style characters, one or
two characters should  be  printed  in  Bold  font.  Putting  a  [~]  before
the character will make NJStar  print  this  character  in  Bold  font.  For
example,

          [EXAMPLE]     Ã¿∆¸§œ°¢~¿ß~»Û§‰§Î§Ë§¶§À°™

In this case, the last "¿ß»Û" will be  printed  as  a  Bold style, while the
whole sentence will be in thin style.

This  function  only  works  for  printers capable of using 24x24 or  better
fonts.

UTILITY  PRINTPS.EXE

NJStar  supports  postscript  printers  with  a  separate  utility  program,
PRINTPS.EXE. This program converts a EUC file to a set  of PostScript  files
according to the font and page size selected by the user.  This  program  is
provided for registered users only; check UTILITY.DOC for more details.
