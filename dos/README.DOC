                            INTRODUCTION

NJSTAR is a Japanese word processor for IBM PC and compatibles. It  supports
the input, display and printing of Japanese characters on the  standard  IBM
computers. NJSTAR features a user friendly  user  interface,  very  easy  to
use. If you want do Japanese word processing or want to  learn  Japanese  on
computer, then NJSTAR is the right software for you.

Many hours of work  have  gone  into  the  development  of  NJSTAR,  and  I
regularly incorporate suggested changes into the product as I am  able  to.
The only way I can continue to provide products like NJSTAR  and  to  offer
outstanding technical support, is for you to register your copy of  NJSTAR.
I like the shareware concept, and I would like to stay a part of it. But  I
can do so only through registrations of NJSTAR. Please don't take this  the
wrong way - try  out  NJSTAR  for  30  days  or  so,  under  no  obligation
whatsoever. But if you found it is useful and continue to use it after that
30-day period, please send your bank check for your registration copy to:

Payment Methods:
----------------

Please send US dollar personal check or bank check/draft  if  possible.  If
you have difficulty in obtaining US dollar bank check/draft, you  can  send
US dollar cash or signed US$ traveller's check in a registered mail. So far
I have not had any problem with cash. European user can send EuroCheque  in
US dollars. The  last  option  is  to  use  your  local  currency  if  it's
internationally convertible (eg. GBP, DM,  Franc,  Japanese  Yen,  Canadian
dollar etc..).  Please  calculate  your  local  currency  amount  using the
following formula:

                         US$79 + $10 (S/H) + $5 (Conversion Charge)
       Local Currency = -----------------------------------------------
                                 Current Exchange Rate

We are regret that we are unable to accept following payment:

       a). US dollar check which is not drawn from an US Bank (eg Canada)
       b). Postal money order (other than from Australian Post);
       c). Credit cards.

===========================================================================
                       HISTORY OF NJSTAR DEVELOPMENT

21/05/92
     Add: International keyboard support (any country supported by DOS)
          keyboard driver must be installed before staring NJSTAR, for
          example to install German keyboard.

          C:\> keyb gr

          NOTE:
           1. The keyboard mapping of command<keyboard> must be set to
              English(0).
           2. If the special character is in the range of ASCII:161-254,
              then this char (except char: beta)is ignored since JIS
              code uses ASCII:161-254 to code Japanese two byte character.

27/05/92 
     add: 1. -m option for NJSTAR.exe - for MonoEGA, MonoVGA/MCGA (640x480x2).
          2. NJSTAR CGA version - NJJCGA.exe - 11 lines display without menu.
             (NJJCGA.EXE is supplied at request, not every one need it)

31/05/92
     Improve: The line number calculation and display speed is 2 times faster.
     Add:  1. Super VGA display 800x600, support most of SVGA cards. But mouse
              cursor not displayed because some tricky problem not solved yet.
           2. -s option forcing NJSTAR to run in SVGA 800x600 mode.
           3. 'V'ideo and keyboard option in NJCONFIG.
12/06/92
     Improve: NJSTAR will create AUTOSAVE.NJX in the same directory as
              NJSTAR.EXE, and autosave is only ON if file modified.

12/06/92
          NJSTAR Now works on EGA, MonoEGA, MonoVGA/MCGA, VGA, XGA, SuperVGA
          (see SUPER.VGA) 800x600 graphics cards.

16/06/92 ADD: Printer driver CANONLBP.DRV for Canon LBP-8 II and III Laser
              printer. It will probably work on Canon LBP-4, but not tested.

     Improve: The space between number and Japanese character on bottom line
              can be configured to be none if the following question is
              answered with a '0' in NJCONFIG's 'G' option.

     Enter char displayed after number at bottom line(0 for none)[32]: 0

     In above question, user can enter a number for ascii code of a char,
     eg. 44 for '-', or user can enter the character to be displayed. eg. ':'

26/06/92
        Add: Automatic word wrapping for English/European words.
        Add: ASCII space (32) and Kanji space(EUC:a1a1) is specially displayed
             when End of line is displayed.

27/06/92
        Add: <SaveShiftJis>[#F6] for save current file in Shift-JIS format.
             New entry added on main menu under 'Output'.

             NJSTAR can automatically detect Shift-JIS when loading. But since
             EUC and shift-JIS have some overlapping coding space, there could
             be some errors. Those errors only occur for un-commonly used
             Kanji (>Group 63). So this is not a big problem. If you are sure
             the file is Shift-JIS, than please use option '-j' at NJSTAR's
             command line. For Example:

                NJSTAR -j file.sjs

             This will eliminate the detection error.

             If you are using NJSTAR for European special character
             (Ascii: 128-160), then you better not use Shift-JIS at all,
             since Shift-JIS also use ascii:128-160 for coding. You have to
             turn off NJSTAR's auto detection for Shift-JIS by answering the
             following question in NJCONFIG 'G' option as 'NO',

             'Do you want detect Shift-JIS automatically (Yes/No)?' NO

             NJSTAR has the ability to coding European character by using
             EUC internally, but it can not code the characters for drawing
             boxes. On the other hand, Shift-JIS can have box drawing
             character, but it is unable to code European special characters.
             You win some, you lose some.

23/07/92 Improve: Now <Search> and <SearchReplace> are case insensitive, unless
                  search string is terminated by Alt+Enter instead of Enter.

30/07/94 Add: Screen Saver. The interval(in Min.) can be configured in NJCONFIG
              'G' option. The screen saver can be activated by place mouse
              cursor on top right corner of the screen (wait 2 seconds). If
              you place mouse cursor on bottom left or bottom right corner of
              the screen, the screen saver is disabled.

31/07/92 Improve: NOW mouse works under SVGA 800x600 mode, Special Thanks to
                  Frank Klemm in Germany for providing mouse display routines.

         Add: Command <OpenFile>[^F8], it is same as <EditFile>+F1, Press mouse
              Right button on bottom line will invoke this function. Press
              Middle button on bottom line will get the <QuickHelp> screen.

06/09/92 Add: Support for half size Kana in shift-JIS, which is commonly used
              in IBM's Japanese DOS/V. To Read ShiftJIS file with half size
              Kana, please use:
                                  NJSTAR -j filename.ext

10/11/92 Add: NJ24.EXE for modifying 24x24 JIS font: JIS.24

Latest version: Version 2.1j Plus

20/02/93 Add command: <ExInput>[@F2] for selection of all external input
                      methods, as described below:

         b. bushu   - Input Japanese by entering it's Radical number (total 214)
         c. 4corner - Input Japanese by entering it's four corner code
