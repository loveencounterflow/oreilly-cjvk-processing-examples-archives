--- BEGIN ---
	I recently picked up an interesting book at the San Francisco
Japan Center's Kinokuniya Bookstore entitled "America and The Four
Japans: Friend, Foe, Model, Mirror" by Frederik Schodt. A great book,
I think.
	I am not typically interested in (or knowledgable about)
Japanese or American-Japanese politics, but I found Fred's book a
particular gem in that it had no political overtones, which are
(unfortunately) common in many books about Japan today.
	In summary, I found Fred's book enlightening, easy-to-read,
and full of cross-cultural examples (shows how much alike we all are). 
I highly recommend it.
	Perhaps there are others out there who have read this book. I
would like to hear your opinions on this book, or better yet, post
them for others to read.
	Here are this book's vital statistics:
