INTRODUCING KANJIWORKS

KanjiWorks is a new Kanji learning aid for Macintosh users that will help students learn Japanese kanji characters faster and easier than ever before.  The product of years of development, KanjiWorks has been designed for any student of Japanese with a Macintosh computer and an interest in kanji.

KanjiWorks features a revolutionary new kanji look-up method, permitting you to reference kanji by On/kun reading, English meaning, stroke-count, radical, contained element, or any combination of the last three.  You can specify up to 8 contained elements to narrow down the search. You can also reference a kanji directly from the front-end processor if you use KanjiTalk or the Japanese Language Kit. It is also possible to reference kanji by their JIS, SJIS, EUC, Unicode, or KUTEN codes, and by Nelson's, Halpern's, and Spahn & Hadamitzky's character dictionary reference numbers.

Custom lists permit you to concentrate only on the kanji you want to study.  Kanji recognition tests drill you on the characters you want to master.  Floating windows and search palettes make KanjiWorks fun and easy to use.  One click of the mouse brings up all the kanji with a given element, reading, or stroke count.

KanjiWorks displays the stroke-order for each kanji, broken into elements (radicals) and kanji characters, rather than single strokes. Clicking on any contained element within the stroke order diagrams calls up animated brush strokes of that element, and a mini-tutor for the 214 radicals and their variants. 

The wealth of information contained in KanjiWorks make it a useful  program for any student of kanji.  There are enough characters, compounds, and example sentences in KanjiWorks to satisfy the needs of most college-level students of Japanese.  And future upgrades to larger data-sets will help your dictionary grow into a complete desk-top reference set and tutor.
 
KanjiWorks *does* *not* *require* the Japanese Language Kit, KanjiTalk  (although it is recommended for superior performance), or any other software.  KanjiWorks is a stand-alone application that can be installed on a Mac Classic or above running System 7. Note: 32-bit addressing mode must be set 'On' using the 'Memory' control panel. A Macintosh computer with at least a '030 processor is recommended. To get the best performance, use KanjiWorks in a fast Macintosh computer with KanjiTalk or the Japanese Language Kit with a TrueType font.
 
KanjiWorks Extended Version 1.5 contains 6,355 kanji with their reference information (including the 1,945 "joyo" kanji and 285 "jinmei-yo" kanji), about 3000 example sentences, and over 50,000 words from the famous Japanese Character Dictionary with Compound Lookup Via Any Kanji  by Mark Spahn and Wolfgang Hadamitzky; and English Core Meanings from Jack Halpern's New Japanese-English Character Dictionary.

KanjiWorks Advanced Version 1.5 contains 2,229 kanji their reference information (including the 1,945 "joyo" kanji and 284 "jinmei-yo" kanji), about 3,000 example sentences, and a small dictionary of 8,000 basic kanji compounds, and English Core Meanings from Jack Halpern's New Japanese-English Character Dictionary.

KanjiWorks requires 2500K of free memory. If you have Japanese text processing capability (preferably with a TrueType font), KanjiWorks Extended requires about 12 Mb of disk space.  The all-systems compatible Extended version requires about 17Mb of disk space. 
 
The KanjiWorks Demo is a full working model of the KanjiWorks program. With the 80 basic Elementary 1 level kanji, about 700 example sentences, and 1200 kanji compounds, beginning students will find the demo a good place to start learning the kanji.

* Introduction
	
	KanjiWorks is a computerized kanji learning aid and reference tool. Three versions are available: Intermediate, Advanced and Extended. The Intermediate version has 1,006 kanji, about 4,000 compounds and 1,500 example sentences. The Advanced has 2,229 kanji, about 8,000 compounds and 3,000 sentences. The Extended version has 6,355 kanji, about 58,000 dictionary entries including the entire contents of Spahn & Hadamitzky's Japanese Character Dictionary, and 3,000 example sentences. All versions are inclusive -- the Advanced version contains all data from the Intermediate, and the Extended contains all the data of the Advanced.

	The basics of KanjiWorks are documented in the readme files from previous versions. You should read the previous Readme files before  reading this file. This Readme file only documents the new features of KanjiWorks 1.5 -- particularly the release of the new KanjiWorks Extended program. This Readme file is not  intended as an introduction  to KanjiWorks.


* KanjiWorks Extended V1.5

	KanjiWorks Extended V1.5 is conceptually different from the Intermediate and Advanced versions. The Intermediate and Advanced versions are primarily learning aids. The Intermediate version is mainly for beginning students -- it covers the kanji taught through grade 6 of elementary school. The Advanced version covers the "Newspaper" kanji - the 2,229 kanji recommended for use in daily newspapers. It also includes about 8,000 strategically selected compounds. Neither the Intermediate or Advanced version is a complete kanji dictionary -- while they contain a wealth of reference information from the kanji and a solid basis for studying kanji compounds, they are at best a learner's dictionary. KanjiWorks Extended is intended to bridget the gap left by the Intermediate and Advanced versions of KanjiWorks -- KanjiWorks Extended is a complete kanji dictionary suited to the needs of the most advanced students of Japanese.

	KanjiWorks Extended V1.5 packs a triple-punch of extended reference power. The extended database consists of 6,355 kanji entries, over 58,000 word entries including the entire contents of Spahn & Hadamitzky's Japanese Character Dictionary, and English core meanings from Jack Halpern's New Japanese-English Character Dictionary. 

	The database of 6,355 kanji entries rivals that of almost any other Kanji-English dictionary. In fact, there are more kanji entries in KanjiWorks than in either Nelson's Japanese-English Character Dictionary, or Jack Halpern's New Japanese-English Character Dictionary. And of course you will find convenient cross-reference to both of these dictionaries in KanjiWorks.

	KanjiWorks Extended also contains a complete on-line database of Japanese words and kanji compounds including Mark Spahn & Wolfgang Hadamitzky's famous Japanese Character Dictionary With Compound Lookup via Any Kanji. This dictionary is widely regarded as the best Japanese-English character dictionary for kanji compounds (juku-go).

	Finally, KanjiWorks Extended V1.5 now features Jack Halpern's English core meanings for 2,132 of the most common kanji. Mr. Halpern spent 17 years analyzing kanji in context, and his core meanings Ð published in his highly regarded New Japanese-English Character Dictionary Ð are widely regarded as the most accurate, concise, and authoritative definition of kanji meaning. Rather than provide only reading-specific meanings, like most other Kanji-English dictionaries before NJECD, Mr. Halpern examined kanji meaning from a contextual point-of-view. His goal was to pinpoint the essential, or "core", meaning of the most common kanji in a single English word. These core meanings are now included in KanjiWorks.


* Installation

If you are a KanjiWorks 1.0, 1.1 or 1.2 user, KanjiWorks Extended V1.5 is a complete upgrade. Although you can still convert your old V1.x lists and notes for use with V1.5, you will need to completely reinstall the V1.5 program and use the new V1.5 KW Prefs, KW Lists and KW Notes files with this version.

The first thing you will notice after installing and launching KanjiWorks Extended for the first time is that KanjiWorks is now personalized. You will be asked to enter your name and organization. This information will then become part of the start-up screen for KanjiWorks Extended, and will appear every time the program is launched.


* Extended Dictionary Database

KanjiWorks Extended is designed to be a complete on-line Kanji-English Dictionary. KanjiWorks Extended includes the 6,355 JIS level 1 and 2 kanji, along with complete reference information including readings, meanings, core meanings, readings used in names, variants, stroke order diagrams, pin-yin readings, and more. If you have been using KanjiWorks Intermediate or Advanced, all windows and information are displayed exactly where you expect them to be.


* English Core Meanings

The only new reference data for the kanji entries is the addition of Jack Halpern's English core meanings. Mr. Halpern included 2,132 core meanings in his New Japanese English Character Dictionary. Mr. Halpern's core meanings (core meanings are provided for all 1,945 joyo kanji, and 188 of the jinmei kanji) are indicated by a bullet (¥). 


* Japanese Character Dictionary On-Line

The database for KanjiWorks Extended now includes a huge kanji dictionary licensed from Mark Spahn & Wolfgang Hadamitzky. The database includes all of Spahn & Hadamitzky's 58,000 entries from their Japanese Character Dictionary With Lookup via Any Kanji. Entries from JCD can be accessed through the new Dictionary Window, or through the enhanced Find Window. Furthermore, KanjiWorks search and reference features like the KanjiReader now draw on this powerful dictionary to help you translate and reference almost any kanji or compound in almost any Japanese text file.


* Dictionary Window

The Dictionary Window, formerly the Kanji Compounds Window, has been completely redesigned. To accommodate the larger database of over 58,000 words, the Dictionary Window now displays kanji compounds for the browsed kanji by the position of that kanji in the compound. The position of the kanji can be selected by clicking on the numbered position icon in the top right corner of the Dictionary Window.

The Dictionary Window now has 3 sizes in order to accommodate large size monitors. You can adjust the size of the Dictionary Window by clicking on the Zoom Box in the upper right corner of the title bar of the Dictionary Window. The window size of the Dictionary Window and KanjiReader can also be adjusted from the KanjiReader and Dictionary Settings.


* Kanji Cross-Reference Window

The Kanji Cross Reference Window, newly designed for KanjiWorks Extended, helps students better learn and understand repeated graphic patterns and elements that underpin kanji structure. Open the Kanji Cross Reference Window (by selecting "Cross-Reference" from under the Windows menu), and you can find all kanji that contain more than one element used to build the kanji being browsed. The Kanji Cross-Reference Window will help students build familiarity with common graphic patterns so that they will be able to better recognize kanji they might not even have encountered in the course of their general studies.

You might use the Kanji Cross-Reference Window, for example, to quickly seek common graphic patterns in specific kanji you are studying. Or you can build custom lists of kanji with common elements or patterns without having to perform complicated searches. 


* Powerful Reference Feature

With KanjiWorks Extended, you can now search for specific kanji compounds instead of having to search for a single kanji and then scroll through a list of compounds. To search for a specific compound, open the Find Window, and make the box "Dictionary Entry" active. (Use command-click to deselect all other boxes automatically.) Enter the compound you want to reference, and click "Find." If you want to search by a Romaji reading, be sure to make the box "Romaji Reading" active. Alternatively, put an exclamation point "!" before the case-sensitive reading. (For eg., "!yama" or "!SAN".) 

The Find Window now allows the use of operands to help customize your kanji searches. You can use a comma (",") to perform multiple simultaneous searches. In other words, you can find all kanji with a meaning of either "love" or "hate" in a single search. KanjiWorks will then display all kanji with meanings of "love" followed by all kanji with meanings of "hate" in the Dictionary Window. 

You can also use the asterisk ("*") as a "wild-card" to search for kanji with English meanings beginning with a string of letters. For example, by entering "continu*" into the Find  Window, you would find all entries with meanings of "continue", "continuation", "continually", "continuous", etc. 

You can use the operand "&" to reference kanji by using multiple search criteria. In other words, by entering "love&!REI" KanjiWorks will reference all kanji that have both a meaning of "love" and a reading of "rei". (Remember to put an "!" before Romaji readings, and to capitalize ON readings.)

You can use the "?" operand to set the particular position of a kanji you want to reference. For example, you can search for a character in the third position by entering "??" followed by the character you want to reference.


* Large-Size Example Sentences

The characters used to display the sentences in the Example Sentences Window are now in 18-point. This makes the sentences easier to read, especially on large monitors.

In addition to the larger point size, two hyper-text reference features have been added to the Example Sentences Window. First, each individual kanji is now hyper-text sensitive. This means that you can reference any kanji in the Example Sentences Window by just clicking on it. Additionally, Command-clicking on a kanji in this window will bring up the Find Window, allowing you to perform more sophisticated searches with that kanji.


* Making a Text Image of a Kanji

You can make an ASCII-generated text image of any kanji by selecting "Make a text image of kanji" from the Edit menu. You can select any of several options for making the text image including the font type, point size, and ASCII character used to make up the kanji.

You can then paste the ASCII-generated character into your favorite word processor or text editor. (The ASCII image is stored in your clip-board). You should note that the "marker" character you use makes a great deal of difference in how the final text image turns out.
