Read Me:
 
If you use the Chinese Language Kit (CLK) version 1.0 or 1.1 on System 7.5, you
should update your system with the CLK Updater for System 7.5 v1.1.1. The
Updater will improve the functionality of both CLK 1.0 and 1.1, and will also
make it possible to use the CLK with QuickDraw GX technology.  Do not use the
Updater if you are not running System 7.5.
 
Using the Chinese Language Kit Updater for System 7.5 v1.1.1 Disk:
Use the Updater program AFTER you have installed the Chinese Language Kit 1.0
or 1.1 software. To install the CLK Updater for System 7.5 v1.1.1, double-click
the Installer script and follow the on-screen instructions.
 
If you have installed only one version of Chinese (Simplified or Traditional)
and later decide to install the other language script, you must use the Updater
program again after installing the second script. (If you have already
installed both Simplified and Traditional Chinese, you only need to use the CLK
Updater once.)
 
System Requirements:
To install the CLK Updater for System 7.5 v1.1.1 on the Chinese Language Kit,
you need the following:
 
¥ Macintosh system software version 7.5.
 
¥ A hard disk with at least:
   Ð 8 MB for Simplified Chinese and its TrueType fonts.
   Ð 15 MB for Traditional Chinese and its TrueType fonts.
   Ð 22 megabytes (MB) of disk space for both Simplified and Traditional
   Chinese and their TrueType fonts.
 
¥ 8 MB of  random-access memory (RAM) are recommended for System 7.5 plus the
Chinese Language Kit;
 
¥ 12 or more MB of RAM are recommended for System 7.5, with QuickDraw GX and/or
PowerTalk, and the Chinese Language Kit.
 
¥ For Performa Users:
If you have a Macintosh Performa, you may experience difficulties installing
the CLK. If this is the case, do the following:
  -ÊRemove the "Launcher" file from the active System Folder (Drag "Launcher"
    to another folder while the Language Kit is being installed)

¥If you own CLK 1.0:
If you are currently using CLK version 1.0, Apple recommends that you upgrade
your fonts to the new and improved fonts contained in the CLK 1.1.1 upgrade
package. The upgrade is offered for 29USD plus tax, shipping and handling to
owners of CLK 1.0.
 
THE UPGRADE PROGRAM RUNS FROM JANUARY 4, 1995 THROUGH JUNE 12, 1995.  All
orders must be received by JUNE 12, 1995. For more details on how to receive

¥If you own CLK 1.1:
If you are currently using CLK version 1.1, Apple recommends that you use the
Updater to improve functionality with System 7.5 and to enable the QuickDraw GX
technology that is an option with the System 7.5 package.
If you are not running System 7.5, the Updater is not necessary.
 
The CLK 1.1 already includes the fonts in CLK 1.1.1 and therefore, only the CLK
Updater is necessary.
